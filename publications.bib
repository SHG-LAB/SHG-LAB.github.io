  abstract = {The reflected second harmonic (SH) intensity is established to be a quadratic function of voltage applied to the smooth silver-electrolyte interface in a wide range of angles of incidence of the fundamental radiation. The nonlinear reduction problem is solved to recapture the voltage dependence of Rudnick-Stern's parameter alpha(phi) that turns out to be linear in the range from -0.5 to -1.2 V (versus saturated Ag-AgCl electrode). In this range, the electro-induced nonlinearity of conduction electrons is the predominant mechanism behind the electric-field-induced SH. The deviations from linear dependence of alpha(phi) are associated with the specific adsorption of anions.},

A hyper-Rayleigh scattering formalism is used for the description of SHG in these films. Electroinduced and photoinduced effects in SHG are detected, and the saturated concentrations of the electroinduced and the photoinduced spectral forms of this type of bR film are estimated.

The diffuseness and depolarization of the SHG radiation indicate an in-plane island-like inhomogeneity of 2D Gd-layers.

The degree of such effects is governed by the fine structure parameter and subsequently small in low order susceptibilities, yet enhanced at higher orders. One mechanism responsible for the enhancement of magneto-induced contributions to the SHG intensity is related to optical interference in the far-field region of the second harmonic fields generated by nonmagnetic and magneto-induced nonlinear polarizations. An interference model is considered for resonant and nonresonant, centrosymmetric and noncentrosymmetric media and is used to interpret the magneto-induced SHG results of Co nanocrystals and Gd monolayers.},

  abstract = {In this article, recently published and new results of nonlinear magnetooptical studies of magnetic photonic band-gap materials-magnetophotonic crystals (MPCs) and microcavities-are surveyed. Nonlinear-optical magnetic Kerr effect in MPC with a half-wavelength-thick Bi-substituted yttriurn-iron-garnet layer sandwiched between two dielectric Bragg, reflectors is studied in transversal, longitudinal, and polar configurations of the dc magnetic field application when the fundamental radiation is in the resonance with the allowed microcavity mode located in the photonic band gap. Localization of the resonant fundamental radiation in the garnet spacer enhances the absolute values of both nonmagnetic (crystallographic) and magnetization-induced components of second-harmonic, generation manifold. Specific symmetry properties of magnetization-induced second-harmonic generation (MSHG) allow the observation of magnetization-induced variations in the intensity and relative phase of the second-harmonic (SH) wave in transversal configuration. Magnetization-induced variations in the SH intensity with a contrast up to 0.7 and relative SH phase shifts up to 180degrees are observed upon changing, the dc magnetic field direction. They are odd in magnetization due to the interference between magnetization-induced an nonmagnetic components of the SH field that manifest the internal homodyne effect in MSHG. The longitudinal nonlinear-optical magnetic Kerr effect reveals itself in rotation of the polarization plane of the reflected H wave, which reaches values up to 250degrees/mum. The polarization rotation of the SH wave in the polar configuration is found to be approximately 20degrees/mum for fundamental radiation with a wavelength of 860 nm.},

We demonstrate that many-fold amplification of the nonlinear magneto-optical effects is attained within the spectral edge of the photonic band gap and within the microcavity mode as compared to linear magneto-optical analogs. Strong light localization as well as the realization of the phase matching conditions are discussed as possible mechanisms of the observed enhancement of the nonlinear magneto-optical effects.},

Here we report on the synthesis of benzylammonium lead iodide (BALI) perovskite microcrystals made via antisolvent diffusion method. The use of polystyrene (PS) matrix helps the growth of environmentally stable BALI nanocrystals as a result of polymer capping. Optimization of the ratio of BALI-PS during the self-assembly process leads to the formation of defect-free composite microspheres. Further, these BALI crystals act as an active material within the microsphere resonators that display whispering gallery modes (WGM). These WGMs are responsible for high optical storage energy of resonators evidenced by their Q-factor as high as {$\sim$}1180. Two-dimensional finite difference time-domain calculation shows the concentration of the electric field near the microspheres boundary within a small mode volume of 1.83 {$\mu$}m3. Remarkably, BALI-PS composite microresonators and their neat crystals exhibit brilliant two-photon luminescence upon excitation by the infrared fundamental radiation.

  abstract = {We report some results of studying optical second harmonic generation (SHG) on surfaces and at interfaces of centrosymmetric media, in resonant nano- and microstructures, and in ferroelectric materials. The research was carried out at the Department of Quantum Electronics of the Lomonosov Moscow State University under the supervision of Professor O.A. Aktsipetrov, and subsequently developed by his disciples. As examples that clearly demonstrate the possibilities of the SHG method for examining nonstandard objects of nonlinear optics, we discuss the behaviour of the nonlinear optical response of single-crystal silicon and germanium surfaces and their interfaces with oxides, as well as nonlinear electroreflection. Optical interferometry and its possibilities are briefly described using the example of these systems. Unique sensitivity of SHG to the symmetry and resonance properties of nanostructures, including magnetic ones, is shown, which determines the efficiency of this method for investigating such systems. Finally, we demonstrate that the SHG effect is a unique remote and sensitive method for studying ferroelectric structures.},

  abstract = {Incoherent optical second harmonic generation (SHG) is studied from series of multilayer graphene samples of various thickness manufactured by chemical vapor deposition technique and deposited over 150 {$\mu$}m thick glass slides. Two different values of the correlation lengths are obtained from the linear and SHG indicatrices and reveal the existence of two types of optical scatterers. The first one is associated with homogeneous graphene areas, while the second one originates from wrinkles at the interdomain boundaries. Second harmonic imaging microscopy used to map the distribution of the second-order polarization at the nanoscale confirms the results of the nonlinear scattering data.},

  abstract = {Optical second harmonic generation (SHG) is studied from multilayer graphene films in the presence of dc electric current flowing in the sample plane. Graphene layers are manufactured by the chemical vapor deposition technique and deposited on an oxidized Si(001) substrate. SHG intensity from the graphene layer is found to be negligible in the absence of the dc current, while it increases dramatically with the application of the electric current. The current-induced change of the SHG intensity from graphene/SiO2/Si(001) rises linearly with the current amplitude and changes its sign under the reversal of the current direction to the opposite. The observed effect is explained in terms of the interference of second harmonic radiation reflected from the Si surface and that induced by the dc current in multilayer graphene.},

  abstract = {We report spatial localization of the effective magnetic field generated via the inverse Faraday effect employing surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) at Au/garnet interface. Analyzing both numerically and analytically the electric field of the SPPs at this interface, we corroborate our study with a proof-of-concept experiment showing efficient SPP-driven excitation of coherent spin precession with 0.41 THz frequency. We argue that the subdiffractional confinement of the SPP electric field enables strong spatial localization of the SPP-mediated excitation of spin dynamics. We demonstrate two orders of magnitude enhancement of the excitation efficiency at the surface plasmon resonance within a 100 nm layer of a dielectric garnet. Our findings broaden the horizons of ultrafast spin-plasmonics and open pathways toward nonthermal opto-magnetic recording on the nanoscale.},

  abstract = {Magnetization induced second harmonic generation (MSHG) is observed in Gd-containing Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films. The nonlinear optical studies reveal significant alterations in the second harmonic generation (SHG) intensity and in the polarization and phase of the second harmonic (SH) wave induced by application of DC magnetic field. The violation of polarization selection rules and the diffuseness of the MSHG intensity indicates the inhomogeneity of LB structure and the hyper-Rayleigh scattering mechanism of MSHG. The latter proofs the existence of 2D-islands of Gd ions in the structural unit of the LB films which is composed by monolayer of rare-earth ions compressed between two layers of stearic acid molecules.},

  abstract = {Structural and magnetic properties of superstructure consisting of 2D layers of magnetic Gd ions are studied by second harmonic generation (SHG). The incoherent SHG (hyper-Rayleigh scattering) as well as magnetization induced effects in SHG interferometry and second harmonic (SH) polarization diagrams indicate that GD monolayers consist of 2D islands with noncompensated magnetic moment. The periodic structure of Gd layers is confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. The SHG studies were performed using an output of a nanosecond YAG:Nd3+ laser operating at the wavelength of 1064 nm.},

The ferroelectric switching is detected in biased FLC cells by measuring azimuthal dependences of linear and nonlinear responses. The applied dc electric field rotates the FLC symmetry axis with initial and final orientations in the cell plane. Comparative studies of the SHG switching behavior in reflection and transmission geometries allows one to distinguish the contributions from the bulk and the subsurface layers of the cell. The analysis of SHG temperature dependences shows the existence of a strong surface coupling. The temperature-dependent nonlinear polarization shows a critical behavior with the exponent similar to0.3 in SmC* phase.},

  abstract = {Phase transitions in thin (1.5-3 mum) planar cells of a ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) mixture are studied using the optical second harmonic generation (SHG) technique. This method is well known because of its high sensitivity to the structural and electronic properties of surfaces, interfaces and thin films, as well as to the appearance of the ferroelectric state of a material. It is shown that the studied FLC mixture retains a highly regular structure up to about 80 degreesC, when a sharp decrease of SHG intensity, associated with the transition of the LC to the nonpolar (N*) phase, is observed. SHG intensity measurements show that the transition from chiral smectic C (SmC*) to chiral smectic A (SmA*) phase which takes place at about 45 degreesC for the bulk FLC mixture does not influence the ferroelectric state of subsurface FLC layers. At the same time, SHG interferometry measurements show that definite changes in the FLC structure happen above the bulk transition temperature from SmC* to SmA* phase. A DC electric field induced switching of the FLC cells is also observed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The SHG temperature dependences are studied in order to reveal the ferroelectric behaviour of the films. For the monolayer LB films of PVDF/TrFE, as well as for the multiplayer LB films, a wide hysteresis in the SHG intensity under heating and consequent cooling is observed. This hysteresis is attributed to the first-order ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition in the extreme case of literally 2D ferroelectric films. It is demonstrated that the main contribution to the nonlinear response of the LB films of PVDF/TrFE originates from fluctuations of the nonlinear polarization in inhomogeneous film structure.

This thermal detection produces spectra that are insensitive towards light scattering in the sample, as proved experimentally by comparing the spectra of acqueos gold nanorods suspensions in the presence or absence of milk powder. In addition, the microbubble system allows for the interrogation of small samples (below 40 nl) while using a low-intensity beam (around 20 {\textmu}W) for their excitation. In perspective, this system could be implemented for the characterization of turbid biological fluids through their optical absorption, especially when considering that the microbubble resonator naturally interfaces to a microfluidic circuit and may easily fit within portable or on-chip devices.},

The experimental configuration features the MBR as both the vial containing the suspension and the optical transducer, allowing for a sensitive ultra-compact system with a straightforward microfluidic integration. With respect to a previous publication, the active lock of the MBR resonance produced an order-of-magnitude improvement in the system performance and a smooth absorption reconstruction. Additionally, since the detection process is temperature-based, the measurement is intrinsically insensitive towards scattering spectrum, both of the particles and of the host liquid. These features make the MBR system an interesting candidate for the characterisation of extremely small samples in the context of medical diagnosis from whole biological samples, quality controls for food safety or chemical production processes, and, in general, for the measurement of absorption in opaque mediums.},

  abstract = {When the constitutive materials of photonic crystals (PCs) are magnetic, or even only a defect introduced in PCs is magnetic, the resultant PCs exhibit very unique optical and magneto-optical properties. The strong photon confinement in the vicinity of magnetic defects results in large enhancement in linear and nonlinear magneto-optical responses of the media. Novel functions, such as band Faraday effect, magnetic super-prism effect and non-reciprocal or magnetically controllable photonic band structure, are predicted to occur theoretically. All the unique features of the media arise from the existence of magnetization in media, and hence they are called magnetophotonic crystals providing the spin-dependent nature in PCs.},

The resonator is parallelepiped-shaped and composed of a self-assembled donor-acceptor-donor type molecule namely, 9,9,9'',9''-tetramethyl-9H,9'H,9''H-[2,\,2':7,2''-terfluoren]-9'-one (TTO). X-ray crystal structure of an orange-yellow TTO micro-crystal reveals C-H{$\cdot\cdot\cdot$}O type weak intermolecular hydrogen bond between the oxygen atom of the fluorenone unit and fluorine hydrogen atom. For one- and two-photon excitation the micro-crystals exhibit F-P type modes in their photoluminescence signal. The fundamental frequency-dependent NLO intensity shows a continuous increase as the fundamental wavelength is decreasing down to 770\>nm. The two-photon luminescence signals from these micro-resonators are several orders of magnitude higher than the thin films of similar thickness.},

X-ray diffraction analysis shows cube-on-cube epitaxial growth of BiFeO3 on (001) SrTiO3. The strongly reduced bismuth transfer into the film due to the high thermal stability of Bi(C6H5)(3) was counterbalanced by the increase of the total pressure as well as of the residence time of the precursor flow in the reactor; the Bi/Fe ratio in the film thus becomes close to that in the precursor mixture. Optical second harmonic generation measurements have evidenced the ferroelectric ordering in BiFeO3 films and the apparent decrease of the Curie temperature of the strained films as compared to BiFeO3 single crystal.

High thermal stability of Bi(C6H5)(3) makes the film stoichiometry very sensible to the deposition conditions, in particular to the precursor residence time in the reactor. We tested novel precursors Bi(thd)(3) and Bi(CH3COO)(3) possessing lower thermal stability. They drive the process into the diffusion control regime when cation stoichiometry in the layer is easier to control. The possibility to use them for epitaxial growth of BiFeO3 thin films was demonstrated. BiFeO3 film forms the self-organized nanodomain variant structure with (110) out-of-plane orientation on (001) ZrO2(Y2O3) substrate. The high resolution TEM images confirm variant domain structure formation. The ferroelectric nature of BiFCO3 films was assessed at the room temperature by piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM).

  abstract = {Hyperbolic metamaterials based on the ordered arrays of metal nanorods in a dielectric media are of great interest owing to new optical effects appearing in such artificial media. Here we study the effects in the polarization state of light passing through a nanocomposite material consisting of Au nanorods in porous alumina and a similar structure supplemented by a nanolayer of ferromagnetic nickel. We demonstrate that close to the epsilon-near-zero dispersion point, under the transition to the hyperbolic dispersion region, the nanocomposites reveal anomalously high modulation of the polarization state of light, which appears as polarization plane rotation and ellipticity changes of probing radiation with a zero ellipticity. This effect is applied for the giant enhancement of the Faraday effect in a continuous ferromagnetic film staying in contact with hyperbolic material. These findings open a path for the design of polarization state control by using hyperbolic metamaterials.},

  abstract = {Linear and nonlinear optical properties of a thin planar CoFe/Al2O3/CoFe structure for different angles of incidence of the fundamental radiation are studied by means of the magneto-optical Kerr effect and magnetizationinduced second-harmonic generation (SHG). The composition of this multilayered structure supports the appearance of the antiferromagnetic state, which leads to nonreciprocal optical effects and is discussed in terms of the magnetic toroid moment. We show that in accordance with the phenomenological description, SHG magnetic hysteresis loops for a linearly polarized pump beam are determined by linear in magnetization M components of the SHG polarization, while for a circularly polarized pump such a description necessarily involves both linear and quadratic in M components of the nonlinear polarization. Symmetry analysis of the magnetization-induced SHG supports the differences between the cases of linear and circular polarization of the incident radiation observed in the experiment, as well as a partial suppression of first in magnetization SHG contributions. Relative values of the linear and quadratic in magnetization components of the SHG polarization are estimated for the trilayer structure and for a reference homogeneous ferromagnetic film},

  abstract = {Multilayer planar nanostructures formed by ferromagnetic and heavy metals can reveal unique properties governed by their composition and geometry. The main role in their formation belongs to the interfacial spin--orbit interaction leading to specific magnetic distributions and behavior at the nanoscale. Here we present a complex analysis of magneto-optical effects in nanolayered films composed of different combinations of cobalt nanolayers with tantalum and platinum ones. Magnetic force microscopy studies confirm inhomogeneous magnetization distribution in films, which can be described in terms of magnetic ripple domain or chiral structures. Experiments on the Brillouin light scattering directly confirm the appearance of the interface Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in the studied films, the effect increases with the structural asymmetry. Finally, interface-sensitive second harmonic generation (SHG) reveals odd in magnetic field SHG intensity effect for the longitudinal geometry of the applied dc magnetic field that is absent for homogeneously magnetized structures.},

  abstract = {Second harmonic generation by a disordered array of superparamagnetic nanoparticles in a static magnetic field H is studied experimentally. For H = 0, only hyper-Rayleigh scattering takes place; i.e., the second-harmonic radiation is diffuse and unpolarized. For H not equal 0, a coherent (specular and linearly polarized) component appears against the hyper-Rayleigh scattering background. The phase of the coherent component changes by pi when the direction of the magnetic field is reversed. It is shown that the effect can be explained by correlations in the spatial fluctuations of the nonlinear-optical and magnetic polarizabilities of the particles, taking into account the nonuniformity of the effective (local) static magnetic field.},

We demonstrate that extrinsic chirality of an array leads to the CD effect that strongly depends on the azimuthal orientation of the sample. In the absence of magnetization, the value of the SHG CD effect averaged over 2{$\pi$} azimuthal angle is zero, while up to 6\% averaged SHG CD appears as the dc magnetic field is applied along the symmetry axis of the structure. Importantly the averaged SHG CD effect changes its sign under the reversal of the magnetic field, which corresponds to the appearance of magnetization driven true chirality in an array of symmetric magnetic nanostructures.},

Here we study experimentally linear optical and magneto-optical response of arrays of plasmonic gold nanorods and similar structures complemented by a thin nickel film. We show that both types of structures reveal distinct optical features expected for hyperbolic media and associated with the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) and epsilon-near-pole (ENP) points. In the case of Ni-containing nanocomposites, we observe linear magneto-optical effects in transmission through the structure, increasing in the vicinity of these points. This observation reveals an important role of the local field enhancement in a hyperbolic medium associated with ENZ and ENP dispersion points in the appearance of magneto-optical activity of magnetic hyperbolic metamaterials.},

One of the possible approaches here is based on the introduction of additional structured magnetic coverages interacting with the garnet layer. Inthis study, we demonstrate that arrays of asymmetric ferromagnetic cobalt particles regularly arranged on the surface of Lu,Bi-substituted iron garnet film influence the orientation and width of the stripe domains, as stems from the optical microscopy, magneto-optical and diffraction studies. We also show that triangular-shaped Co particles induce the asymmetry of the magnetic field dependence on the magneto-optical Kerr effect of the composite structure. We assert that the key effect here is the interaction of the residual magnetic moments of Co particles with thesurface closure domains.},

An increase in the efficiency of the optical second harmonic generation in the spectral vicinity of zero effective permittivity (epsilon near zero) of hyperbolic metamaterials, as well as a jump of the phase of a quadratic nonlinear optical signal, is detected at the transition between elliptic and hyperbolic dispersion regimes. The resonant enhancement of magneto-optical effects in composite magnetic hyperbolic metamaterials in the spectral vicinity of nearly zero effective permittivity is demonstrated. Effects of fast and slow light in the interaction of ultrashort laser pulses with hyperbolic metamaterials are experimentally revealed.},

A special place here belongs to chiral nanostructures that could compete with the natural materials both in efficiency and size of functional elements. For the case of metamaterials, optical activity originates from a special shape of the elements and their arrangement within an array. This research field has been actively developing over the last years and significant values of chirality effects were observed in the linear-optical response of metallic nanostructures [1]. Furthermore, chirality effects are more pronounced in the nonlinear-optical response of such structures [2,3], the latter being governed to a great extent by the local field distribution inside the metal nanostructures. In this talk we will focus mostly on the recent results on the linear and nonlinear optical effects in planar arrays of chiral nanostructures with the shape of a flat spiral (G-shaped nanostructures).},

  abstract = {Artificial hyperbolic metamaterials (HMM) are perspective for the nonlinear optical applications, their exciting functionality being due to the hyperbolic dispersion induced by a strong shape anisotropy. Here we study the second harmonic generation (SHG) in HMM formed by arrays of silver nanorods in anodic alumina. In the hyperbolic dispersion regime, giant SHG is observed associated with the fulfillment of the phase-matching conditions supported by the epsilon-near-pole resonance at the SHG wavelength, and an increase in the pump field in the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) spectral range. We predict a strong increase in the SHG efficiency for metamaterials with the ENZ resonance at the second harmonic frequency.},

  abstract = {The main experimental results that have been recently obtained for the linear and nonlinear opticalresponses of ordered two-dimensional arrays of planar chiral metallic nanostructures are considered. Theseexperimental results demonstrate that the polarization state of the linear and nonlinear optical responses ofmetasurfaces are substantially determined by the chirality of a single nanoelement and the related spatial dis-tribution of the optical second harmonic generation intensity. As a result, circular dichroism effects appear inthe linear and nonlinear optical responses of a chiral metasurface. The anisotropy of the second harmonic isexperimentally shown to play a substantial role in the effects of extrinsic chirality, which is determined by thespatial symmetry of an array of nanoelements. The main properties of circular dichroism in the quadraticoptical response are supported by numerical calculations and symmetry analysis of structures.},

  abstract = {Plasmonic structures are extremely attractive for the light flow manipulation. In turn, the spectrum of the plasmon excitations can be controlled by external magnetic field, thus giving rise to magnetoplasmonics. However, in the case of traditional magnetoplasmonic structures, the enhancement of magneto-optical (MO) effects is often accompanied by the transmission damp, which constricts the area of their applications. This paper examines resonant optical effects in composite structures based on artificial opal films covered by a thin cobalt layer, which forms a 2D hexagonal lattice of nanoholes in the metal film. Such periodic structure exhibits surface plasmon polariton-assisted extraordinary transmission along with the increase of odd in magnetization intensity magnetooptical effect in the Voigt geometry. Local field enhancement accompanying the surface plasmon polaritons excitation in composite Co/opal structure provides a distinct enhancement of the magnetization-induced second harmonic generation (SHG) and relevant MO effects at the SHG wavelength that appear as Fano-type resonances. High transmission along with resonantly-high MO effects make Co/opal films promising in plasmonic applications.},

It manifests itself as a widening and shift of the magnetic hysteresis loop with respect to zero value of the external magnetic field oriented along the pinning direction. In this work, we report on comparative studies of linear and nonlinear magneto-optical effects under the laser-induced switching of the pinning effect in IrMn/CoFe films of various thickness of the ferromagnetic CoFe layer. We found that the magneto-optical response of the pinned AFM/FM nanofilms appears with different hysteresis loop parameters in the transverse magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) and interface-sensitive magnetization-induced second harmonic generation (SHG), indicating the diversity of the magnetic effects at interfaces compared to the bulk of the films.},

The unique possibilities of nonlinear optical diagnostics of anisotropic, vortex, and exchange-biased magnetic structures, visualization of the micromagnetic structure of surface layers of iron--garnets are demonstrated.

Strong increase of the SHG intensity in the vicinity of the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) spectral point accompanied by dramatic phase modulation of the SHG wave is revealed.

We observed the enhancement of the MO effect of up to 0.6\% in the spectral vicinity of the SPP excitation, and several times less strong effect close to the PBG, while the combined appearance of PBG and SPP decreases the resultant MO response. Observed resonant magneto-optical properties of opal/Co heterostructures show that they can be treated as functional self-assembled magnetoplasmonic crystals with resonantly enhanced and controllable MO effect.},

We show the appearance of odd in magnetization intensity effect in the second-harmonic generation (SHG), which correlates with the damping of the magnetization oscillations at the optical wave frequency as was predicted quite recently. The efficiency of the effect is of a few percent as compared to the nonmagnetic SHG and is the most pronounced for the so-called ``forbidden'' SHG geometry, i.e., for the {$p$}-polarized incident and reflected waves in the longitudinal magnetization scheme. This magnetization-dynamics-induced SHG contribution is shown to be anisotropic, sensitive to the angle of incidence of the probe beam, and is the largest for the CoPt films due to the maximum Gilbert damping constant.},

At the Laue geometry of diffraction the incident wave splits into four waves that correspond to the two eigenmodes of the electromagnetic field inside a multilayer 1D PC, the so called Borrmann and anti-Borrmann optical modes. The first one is localized mostly inside the layers with smaller value of the refractive index, while the latter one -- in those with larger refractive index.

  abstract = {We propose non-phase-matched sum frequency generation (SFG) as a method for characterizing broadband multimode light. Both the central wavelength and the bandwidth are in this case not limited by the phase matching condition. As an example, we consider bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) generated through high-gain parametric down conversion (PDC). In the spectrum of SFG from BSV, we observe the coherent peak and the incoherent background. We show that the ratio of their widths is equal to the number of frequency modes in BSV, which in the case of low-gain PDC gives the degree of frequency entanglement for photon pairs. By generating the sum frequency in the near-surface region of a nonlinear crystal, we increase the SFG efficiency and get rid of the modulation caused by chromatic dispersion, known as Maker fringes. This allows one to use non-phasematched SFG as a wavelength-independent autocorrelator. Furthermore, we demonstrate efficient non-phase-matched three- and four-frequency summation of broadband multimode light, hardly possible under phase matching. We show that the latter contains the coherent peak while the former does not.},

The second-harmonic generation properties follow the effective medium description of the metamaterial as a homogeneous layer isotropic in the direction normal to the nanorod axes. Magneto-optical and nonlinear magneto-optical Kerr effects are enhanced in the vicinity of the plasmonic modes of Ni nanorods and of the photonic resonance of the metamaterial layer, while conventional (nonmagnetic) optical response does not exhibit plasmonic-related features. The observed surprisingly high sensitivity of magneto-optical and nonlinear magneto-optical responses to the metamaterial photonic modes is prospective for the diagnostics of plasmonic excitations in magnetic nanostructures and for possible applications in high density magneto-optical data storage.},

We demonstrate that the SHG azimuthal anisotropy is consistent with the 3m symmetry of individual Co nanodots placed in a square surface lattice. Qualitatively different SHG magnetic hysteresis loops are obtained for circular and linear polarizations of the fundamental radiation. In the first case, a wide SHG hysteresis at zero DC magnetic field H is observed, which is attributed to a macroscopic magnetic toroid moment in Co nanodots induced by a noncentrosymmetric distribution of the magnetization. On the contrary, for the linear pump polarization the SHG loop is similar to observed commonly in linear magnetooptics for vortex magnetic structures and reveals a rather narrow width at H=0. A phenomenological SHG description based on the introduction of the SHG polarization induced by a magnetic toroid moment in vortex magnetic nanostructures is presented.},

  abstract = {Porous anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) is widely used as a template for the electrodeposition of ordered arrays of one-dimensional nanostructures. Prior to template filling, the barrier layer, which blocks the pores at their bases, should be removed. However, the increase in AAO porosity during wet-chemical etching of the barrier layer is unavoidable that can limit further application of the templates. In this study, we report the kinetics of ion beam etching of the AAO barrier layer and the application of the technique for preparing AAO templates with the lowest possible porosity: 8\% for the AAO films obtained in 0.3 M oxalic acid at 40 V. The fabrication of Au nanorod-based hyperbolic metamaterials (HMMs) with a certain spectral position of epsilon-near-zero point is demonstrated. Transmission spectra measurement and simulation give self-consistent values of gold volume fraction in the range from 7.3\% to 8.4\% confirming the high reproducibility of the proposed technique for AAO barrier layer etching. Such low volume fraction of metal makes Au nanorod-based HMMs promising candidates for the use in nanophotonic devices with tunable properties that are sensitive to the geometrical parameters of the structural elements. HMMs prepared using templates after chemical etching of the barrier layer possess a higher metal volume fraction and demonstrate a weaker dependence of the ENZ position on the nanorod length.},

  abstract = {Porous films of anodic aluminum oxide are widely used as templates for the electrochemical preparation of functional nanocomposites containing ordered arrays of anisotropic nanostructures. In these structures, the volume fraction of the inclusion phase, which strongly determines the functional properties of the nanocomposite, is equal to the porosity of the initial template. For the range of systems, the most pronounced effects and the best functional properties are expected when the volume fraction of metal is less than 10\%, whereas the porosity of anodic aluminum oxide typically exceeds this value. In the present work, the possibility of the application of anodic aluminum oxide for obtaining hyperbolic metamaterials in the form of nanocomposites with the metal volume fraction smaller than the template porosity is demonstrated for the first time. A decrease in the fraction of the pores accessible for electrodeposition is achieved by controlled blocking of the portion of pores during anodization when the template is formed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been shown in the example of obtaining nanocomposites containing Au nanorods arrays. The possibility for the control over the position of the resonance absorption band corresponding to the excitation of collective longitudinal oscillations of the electron gas in the nanorods in a wide range of wavelengths by controlled decreasing of the metal volume fraction, is shown.},

  abstract = {Hyperbolic metamaterials (HMM) based on multilayered metal/dielectric films or ordered arrays of metal nanorods in a dielectric matrix are extremely attractive optical materials for manipulating over the parameters of the light flow. One of the most promising tools for tuning the optical properties of metamaterials in situ is the application of an external magnetic field. However, for the case of HMM based on the ordered arrays of magneto-plasmonic nanostructures, this effect has not been clearly demonstrated until now. In this paper, we present the results of synthesis of HMM based on the highly-ordered arrays of bisegmented Au/Ni nanorods in porous anodic alumina templates and a detailed study of their optical and magneto-optical properties. Distinct enhancement of the magneto-optical (MO) effects along with their sign reversal is observed in the spectral vicinity of epsilon-near-zero and epsilon-near-pole spectral regions. The underlying mechanism is the amplification of the MO polarization plane rotation initiated by Ni segments followed by the light propagation in a strongly birefringent HMM. This stays in agreement with the phenomenological description and relevant numerical calculations.},

We demonstrate that such structures reveal strong amplification of second-order nonlinear optical response, including optical second harmonic generation (SHG) and two-photon fluorescence (TPF), as compared to that of a continuous film. This is associated with a strong light localization in microstructures composed of high refractive index material. The TPF and SHG power dependencies show that the observed effects are governed by high second-order nonlinearity of the dye damped by a strong absorption. FDTD calculations confirm that the mechanism of the light localization inside organic frustums can be in the form of whispering gallery modes excitation.},

  abstract = {Properties of nanolayers can substantially differ from those of bulky materials, in partdue to pronounced interface effects. It is known that combinations of layers of heavy and ferromagnetic metals leads to the appearance of specific spin textures induced by interface-inducedDzyaloshinskyi--Moria interaction (DMI), which attracts much interest and requires further studies.In this paper, we study magneto-optical effects in two- and three-layer films composed of a fewnanometer thick Co layer adjacent to nanofilms of non-magnetic materials (Pt, W, Cu, Ta, MgO).For experimental studies of the interface magnetization-induced effects, we used the optical secondharmonic generation (SHG) technique known for its high sensitivity to the symmetry breaking. Wefound that the structural asymmetry leads to the increase of the averaged SHG intensity, as well asto the magnetic field-induced effects in SHG. Moreover, by choosing the proper geometry of theexperiment, we excluded the most studied linear in magnetization SHG contributions and, thus,succeeded in studying higher order in magnetization and non-local magnetic effects. We revealedodd in magnetization SHG effects consistent with the phenomenological description involving inhomogeneous (gradient) magnetization distribution at interfaces and found them quite pronounced, sothat they should be necessarily taken into account when analyzing the non-linear magneto-opticalresponse of nanostructures.},

A significant modulation of optical second harmonic generation intensity along stripe domains is detected near the free film surface. This modulation is caused by periodic distortions of the stripe domain structure near the film surface and the presence of surface closure domains detected by magnetic force microscopy (MFM). A series of MFM images of the film taken in an in-plane magnetic field varying from --400 to 400 Oe demonstrates quasi-static nucleation of closure domains periodically located along stripe domains.},

  abstract = {Arrays of metal nanostructures have attracted much interest due to their unique potential as optical nanoantennas and nanosensors. Here we use the second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy technique for the studies of the nonlinear optical (NLO) response of cobalt nanoparticles of triangular and trapezoid shapes separated from a Py/Si3N4 film by a 1.5 nm thick MgO spacer. We demonstrate that the nonsymmetric elongated shape of planar nanoparticles along with the strong light localization effects result in the enhancement of the NLO response, including SHG and two-photon fluorescence. We also demonstrate that the efficiency of the SHG in nanoparticles is rather sensitive to the polarization of the incident laser beam, the visibility of the nanostructures in the nonlinear microscopy images being the highest for the linear polarization of the laser beam.},

  abstract = {Chiral planar metamaterials are known for their possibility to show strong nonlinear optical effects such as second harmonic generation (SHG) circular dichroism or asymmetric SHG. The underlying mechanisms are commonly discussed in terms of local field effects and formation of localized SHG sources (so called ``hotspots'') that are sensitive to the shape and size of meta-atoms. Nevertheless, a full characterization of the polarization state of the nonlinear optical radiation from the hotspots has not been performed until now. Here we present the results of the polarization-resolved second harmonic generation microscopy studies of planar chiral G-shaped metamaterials. We demonstrate that the SHG radiation coming from the hotspots that are localized within a single meta-atom is partially polarized; moreover, the SHG polarization state reveals the chirality of the structure. The observed effects are attributed to the induced plasmonic current oscillations at the fundamental frequency along with the local field distribution},

Here we report on experimental evidence of the WGM in the two-photon fluorescence (TPF) of DCM dye microspheres made using the selfassembly method. The WGM excitation accompanying the overall TPF in the spectral range from 530 {\textdiv} 640 nm demonstrated a quality factor of approximately 102 for spheres that were several microns in diameter. The power dependence of the TPF intensity proved the second order nature of the interaction process involved.},

  abstract = {The structure of magnetic domains is an exciting research object that shows an enormous variety of delightful patterns. Epitaxial garnet is one of the most studied magnetic dielectrics with well-recognized bulk domains, while the magnetic composition at the surface is less investigated. Here we apply the nonlinear optical microscopy technique for the visualization of the interface magnetic domains of 10 {$\mu$}m thick (LuBi)3Fe5O12 film and prove that it is qualitatively similar for both garnet/air and garnet/substrate interfaces. As an efficient extension of the second harmonic generation microscopy, we suggest and demonstrate the possibilities of the third harmonic generation one, which provides higher resolution of the method.},

  abstract = {We survey our recent results on the observation and studies of the effects accompanying the dynamical Bragg diffraction in one-dimensional photonic crystals (PhC). Contrary to the kinematic Bragg diffraction, the dynamical one considers a continuous interaction between the waves travelling within a spatially-periodic structure and is the most pronounced in the so called Laue geometry, leading to a number of exciting phenomena. In the described experiments, we study the PhC based on porous silicon or porous quartz, made by the electrochemical etching of crystalline silicon with the consequent thermal annealing. Importantly, these PhC are approximately hundreds of microns thick and contain a few hundreds of periods, so that the experiments in the Laue diffraction scheme are available. We discuss the effect of the temporal splitting of femtosecond laser pulses and show that the effect is quite sensitive to the polarization and the phase of a femtosecond laser pulse. We also show the experimental realization of the Pendular effect in porous quartz PhC and demonstrate the experimental conditions for the total spatial switching of the output radiation between the transmitted and diffracted directions. All described effects are of high interest for the control over the light propagation based on PhC structures.},

Optical third harmonic generation (THG) is mostly known by its applications in investigation of biological structures, while magneto-optical effects in THG are not well recognized. Here we demonstrate high efficiency of the THG probe in studies of magnetic domain structure of epitaxial garnet films. We show that in spite of relatively small values of the magneto-optical effect at the THG wavelength, the THG microscopy may be efficient for the characterization of magnetic surface domains if the THG wavelength falls in the absorption band of a medium. Moreover, the in-depth sensitivity of this probe may be higher as compared to the case of the second harmonic generation microscopy.},

One of the most efficient methods of fabrication of such microstructures is two-photon laser lithography. However, most polymers used in this technology have a relatively low quantum yield of fluorescence. In this work, the properties of microcavity structures obtained by the indicated method from hybrid polymers with addition of various dyes have been studied. The possibility of formation of high-quality microstructures from activated polymers, conservation of their luminescent properties after polymerization under intense laser irradiation, and reduction of the exposure of two-photon laser lithography by two orders of magnitude in the presence of Coumarin-1 dye has been demonstrated. The nonlinear optical microscopy study has shown that the spatial distribution of scattered fluorescence in microcavity structures based on the polymer with the dye corresponds to the excitation of cavity modes or whispering gallery modes.},

Results of this development are reported and it is shown that the use of optimized lithography schemes, the spatial filtering of laser beam used, and the introduction of laser dyes into polymer lead to the formation of optically homogeneous high-quality bulk microstructures with characteristic features down to 300 nm with necessary functional properties. The capabilities of optimized two-photon laser lithography are demonstrated by examples of ring microcavities and optical waveguides with prism input/output adapters located above a substrate.

We review the most interesting properties of photonic metasurfaces, demonstrating their useful functionalities such as frequency selectivity, wavefront shaping, polarization control, etc. We discuss the ways to achieve tunability of metasurfaces and also demonstrate that nonlinear effects can be enhanced with the help of metasurface engineering.},

Samples synthesized by conventional high-temperature (HT) and room temperature solution-chemistry (SC) methods were used. SHG intensity measurements on a single crystal HT sample reveal a transition temperature T-c = 313 +/- 2 K and a thermal dependence similar to that of the calculated spontaneous polarization; the frequency conversion efficiency is 26 times that of Y-cut quartz. A comparative study of HT and SC pressed-powder pellets suggests that short-range electric dipole order is associated with limited correlation lengths in the latter. Evidence is also given for a phase transition at 309 K in the SC sample. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

These enantiomerically pure micro-optical waveguides generate one-, two-, three-photon pumped optical emissions.

Using nonlinear singleparticlemicroscopy, we demonstrate that these microspheres provide excitation of whisperinggallery modes (WGMs) in two- and three-photon excited luminescence with a Q-factor ofup to 300. We also demonstrate that the nonlinear circular dichroism is enhanced due tothe WGM excitation and reaches 7.7\% and 11\% in the two- and three-photon absorption,respectively. Pronounced modulation of the WGMs spectrum due to the mode's splitting isobserved in coupled binol-based microresonators, which opens a path for the control over theirresonant response and makes them suitable for nonlinear optical sensing applications.},

Mainly, tunable second-harmonic generation (SHG) with continuous-wave (CW) pump sources is considered as breakthrough technology for optical switching, actuation, sensing, chip-integrated coherent light sources, and low-threshold tunable microlasers. Here, the discovery of tunable CW SHG in a polar (non-centrosymmetric) electro-mechanical microcrystal cavity of 4-(4-(methylthio)phenyl)-2,6-di(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine (UOH1) is demonstrated. As a result of total internal reflection in mirror-like light-reflecting facets and its high second-order nonlinear susceptibility, the octahedron-shaped cavities exhibit both bright femtosecond and CW-pumped SHG with coherent whispering gallery mode (WGM) and bow-tie-like (BT) optical modes excited in its spectrum. Moreover, for an external dc electric field of about 23 kV cm-1 the microcavity displays 0.18 nm resonant wavelength peak shift in the second harmonic signal due to electrostriction (strain effect).},

  abstract = {Optical second-harmonic (SH) generation in planar Au/Co/Si(111) nanostructures under application of static magnetic and electric fields is studied experimentally. The crystallographic, magneto- and electroinduced contributions to the SH intensity reveal strong azimuthal anisotropy peculiar to the Si(111) surface. The transient times characterizing the electroinduced quadratic response are found to exceed 1\,s. Relative amplitudes and phases of the magneto- and electroinduced constituents of the SH signal are estimated from the measurements data.},

  abstract = {Structural features of diamondlike metal-doped carbon films are studied by means of optical second-harmonic generation (SHG). A high interfacial sensitivity of the SHG probe and its significant enhancement in metal nanoparticles allows one to distinguish between clusterlike and amorphous atomic scale structure of carbon-metal composites. These films appear to retain a stable amorphous atomic-scale structure in a wide range of metal concentration above the percolation threshold. Atomic-to-mesoscopic scale structural transition in diamondlike metaldoped carbon films is observed, which takes place under the thermal annealing. (C) 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

A noticeable SHG azimuthal anisotropy and a low level of the diffuse second-harmonic (SH) signal indicate a high degree of orientational ordering of magnetic granules in the film plane. Nonmonotonous dependences on x are observed for the intensity of specular and diffuse SH components and for the NOMOKE magnetic contrast. The latter attains a local maximum, for each film type, at the same value of x as GMR, which is considered as a manifestation of correlation between NOMOKE and GMR. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Magnetic nanostructures reveal unique interface induced properties that differ from those of bulk materials, thus magnetization distributions in interface regions are of high interest. Meanwhile, direct measurement of magnetization distribution in layered nanostructures is a complicated task. Here we study magnetic field induced effects in optical second harmonic generation (SHG) in three-layer ferromagnetic / heavy metals nano films. For a certain experimental geometry, which excludes the appearance of magnetooptical effects for homogeneously magnetized structures, magnetization induced SHG intensity variation is observed. Symmetry analysis of the SHG intensity dependencies on external magnetic field shows that the nonlinear source terms proportional to the out-of-plane gradient component of magnetization govern the observed effect.},

Thin KNbO3 films of the average thickness from 20 to 150 nm possess a grainlike structure with a lateral grain size of about 250 nm. Such films reveal ferroelectric properties similar to KNbO3 single crystal. Temperature dependencies of optical second harmonic generation intensity show that the Curie temperature T-C of the nanometer-thick KNbO3 films is about 30 degrees C lower than the T-C of KNbO3 single crystal, which is attributed to size effects in KNbO3 nanograins.

  abstract = {Magnetic field induced effects in the second-harmonic generation in a thin asymmetric Ta/Co/Pt trilayer film with in-plane magnetic anisotropy are investigated. It is shown that the rotation of the polarization plane of the second-harmonic wave in the longitudinal magneto-optical Kerr effect configuration is as large as 37{\textbackslash}circ, which corresponds to a relative contribution from the magnetic field induced component of the second-harmonic field of about 30\% and significantly exceeds the magnitude of the same effect for Co/Pt bilayer structures. It is shown that magnetization reversal in the Ta/Co/Pt structure occurs via the rotation of the magnetization vector within the film plane, and its direction is determined by the orientation of the easy magnetization axis of the structure relative to the applied field. The odd in magnetization contribution is experimentally observed in the intensity of the second harmonic in the longitudinal Kerr effect geometry, although it is forbidden by symmetry for the surfaces of uniformly magnetized structures.},

  abstract = {Incoherent optical second harmonic (SH) generation, or hyper-Rayleigh scattering (HRS), is used to study the structure and properties of Gd/C18H36O2 multilayer Langmuir-Biodgett (LB) films. SH reflection spectra (in combination with linear absorption spectra), HRS indicatrices, thickness dependence, and wave polarization diagrams are measured for s-polarized fundamental radiation. The SH radiation is entirely diffuse but pre-dominantly s polarized, with the maximum of the HRS indicatrix shifted by 8{\textbackslash}circ relative to the specular direction, which is interpreted as being due to the contribution of a fluctuating quadrupole to the nonlinear-optical response of the films. The estimated correlation length of spatial fluctuations of the nonlinear-optical polarization in the film is {$\sim$}400 nm. These properties are associated with an islandlike structure formed by Gd ions inside LB structural units. {\copyright} 2000 Optical Society of America.},

  abstract = {The structural and magnetic properties of a cobalt nanolayer placed between a silicon substrate and a protective gold layer are studied. At a cobalt layer mass thickness of 1-2 nm, a nanoisland structure is shown to form. This thickness range is characterized by a local maximum of the magnetooptical Kerr effect and enhanced nonlinear optical and magnetic nonlinear optical responses at the second-harmonic frequency. This enhancement can be caused by the excitation of local surface plasmons and an increase in the local fields at the probing-radiation and second-harmonic frequencies in metallic nanoislands. The surface-sensitive nonlinear magnetooptical Kerr effect at the second-harmonic frequency is maximal at a cobalt layer thickness of about 2 nm, which corresponds to the characteristic scale of magnetization formation in the near-surface layer in cobalt.},

The microcavity is formed from a half-wavelength-thick Bi-substituted yttrium-iron-garnet film sandwiched between two high-finesse dielectric Bragg reflectors. The transversal nonlinear magneto-optical Kerr effect reveals itself in magnetization-induced variations of the intensity and the relative phase of the second-harmonic wave. The variations reach the factor of 4 in intensity and 180degrees in phase for opposite directions of the dc-magnetic field. The longitudinal and polar nonlinear magneto-optical Kerr effects manifest themselves in the considerable, up to 50degrees, rotation of the second-harmonic wave polarization.},

  abstract = {Magnetization-induced third harmonic (TH) generation was observed in magnetic nanostructures-nanogranular CoxAg1 - x films-possessing giant magnetoresistance (GMR). The magnetization-induced contribution to the TH intensity was studied as a function of the concentration of a magnetic component (cobalt) in the films. Magnetic contrast of the TH intensity was found to correlate with the GMR coefficient: both parameters simultaneously reach extremum in the range of cobalt concentrations x similar to 0.3-0.35.

One of the mechanisms of the enhancement of magnetization-induced contributions to the SHG intensity is related to the optical interference in the far-field region of the second-harmonic fields generated by nonmagnetic and magnetization-induced nonlinear polarizations. The model of interference is considered for resonant and off-resonant conditions in non-centro-symmetric media.

  abstract = {We present experimental and theoretical studies of the anomalous high transmission of light (the Borrmann effect) under the Laue diffraction in a one-dimensional photonic crystal (PhC) characterized by spatial modulation of both refractive index and absorption. We show that a strong modulation of the refractive index along with the large PhC period provide new features of the Borrmann effect as compared to the well-known x-ray Borrmann effect in crystals appearing in PhC wavelength-angular transmission spectra. Namely, the maximal transmission is attained at the Bragg angles of incidence and corresponds alternatively to even or odd orders of the Bragg angles depending on the light wavelength. Second, a dramatic decrease of the angular width of the high transmission areas in the spectrum appear near the diabolic points. According to our description, this effect can be treated as a result of the topological phase transition accompanied by exchange of the parity of spatial distribution of the electromagnetic field of the two eigenmodes experiencing degeneracy. We demonstrate that these peculiarities are inherent to the PhC with the optical losses located in layers with higher refractive index, and disappear if the losses are specific for the PhC layers with lower refractive index. The suggested underlying mechanism involves the contribution of the waveguide PhC modes to the PhC transmission spectra.},

Two mechanisms of the effect are demonstrated, which involve the optical losses associated with light scattering and absorption in nanoporous layers. Absorption is introduced by a small amount of silicon in partially annealed porous silicon PhC. We show that the PhC transmittance increases substantially under the Bragg diffraction condition, which is a manifestation of the Borrmann effect. The observed effects along with their polarization sensitivity are confirmed by numerical calculations.},

We demonstrate the switching between the fast and slow light phenomena via the change of the angle of incidence and/or the central wavelength of chirped pulses in the vicinity of metamaterial zero-transmission regime mediated by the ENZ nonlocality. We elucidate that the laser chirp allows one to manipulate and enhance the fast--slow light phenomena.},

Here, we present a simple remedy to cure this innate flaw. We found that preliminary chirping of the laser pulse prevents the STOV breakup. We supported this analytically and gave the explicit expression of the required chirp value.},

  abstract = {Micro- and nanostructuring of optical media is the cornerstone for a wide range of applications in optics. Artificial structures significantly enrich the interaction of light with dielectrics and metals and are harnessed to reveal exciting optical effects. Recently hypercrystals were proposed as intriguing class of periodic structures bringing together hyperbolic dispersion law of hyperbolic metamaterials and the Bragg diffraction. In this work we proposed the finite-difference frequency-domain method for modeling of light diffraction in these highly anisotropic structures. The method is suitable for one- and two-dimensional gratings as well as multilayer gratings made of anisotropic materials. Developed approach gives advantages over the finite-difference time-domain method (FDTD) and rigorous-coupled mode analysis (RCWA) widely used for calculation of light diffraction in gratings. Proposed method eliminates evaluation of time dynamics and discretization of whole volume of a structure as the FDTD does. Instead, Yee's mesh of the cross section of the unit cell of grating is involved. As well information about the Bloch modes of the field inside the structure inaccessible directly for the FDTD is obtained. We used of values of electromagnetic field in mesh nodes instead Fourier series applied in the RCWA to overcome difficulties of the RCWA for high contrast and highly anisotropic structures as hypercrystals. Using the proposed numerical approach, we demonstrate that interface of one-dimensional hypercrystals formed by ridges of hyperbolic metamaterial can support excitation of the Dyakonov plasmons, which merge the Dyakonov waves supported by the interface of birefringent crystal and surface plasmon polaritons in metals.},

  abstract = {The ability to manipulate the frequency of light is a cornerstone of a wide range of applications in photonics expanding spectral ranges of the light sources. To boost the second harmonic generation efficiency, intense efforts toward exploiting artificial microstructures for frequency doubling were carried out. The sought-after approach of utilizing photonic crystals is inspired by their unusual light dispersion. In such structures, the dynamics of the field of femtosecond laser pulses is of paramount importance for frequency conversion. In this work, we investigate the phase-matched second harmonic generation under the effect of diffraction-induced femtosecond laser pulse splitting in one-dimensional photonic crystals at the Bragg diffraction in the Laue geometry. We demonstrate that the interaction of the two pulses at the fundamental frequency that appears in photonic crystals through the dynamical light diffraction leads to a nonmonotonic dependence of the frequency up-conversion efficiency with respect to the laser pulse duration, thus allowing to increase the second harmonic power by tuning the pulse duration.},

  abstract = {We experimentally and numerically revealed a salient thermal effect in the transmission of the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) metamaterial consisting of an array of plasmonic nanorods in a dielectric template. The flavor of the structure is freestanding nanorod segments surrounded by nematic liquid crystals possessing a strong thermal dependence of the anisotropic refractive index. The observed resonant enhancement of the thermal sensitivity of the transmission of this ENZ structure results from its nonlocal optical response giving rise to the zero-transmission effect, control over which is at the heart of our approach.},

We reveal two features in the Faraday rotation spectra of the structures in the vicinity of the wavelengths of 540 nm and 810 nm, which correspond to the epsilon-near-pole and epsilon-near-zero regions, respectively. Experimentally observed distinct enhancement of magneto-optical effects in the structures in the spectral vicinity of these points are consistent with the simulation results and open up novel opportunities for magnetic-field-assisted light manipulation.},

  abstract = {Organic microstructures attract much attention due to their unique properties originating from the design of their shape and optical parameters. In this work we discuss the linear, second- and third-order nonlinear optical effects in arrays and in individual organic microstructures composed by self-assembling technique and formed randomly on top of a solid substrate. The structures under study consist of micro-spheres, -hemispheres or -frustums made of red laser dye and reveal an intense fluorescence (FL) in the visible spectral range. Importantly, that due to a high value of the refractive index and confined geometry, such micro-structures support the excitation of whispering gallery modes (WGM), which brings about strong and spectrally-selected light localization. We show that an amplification of the nonlinear optical effects is observed for these structures as compared to a homogeneous dye film of similar composition. The obtained data are in agreement with the results of the FDTD calculations performed for the structures of different dimensions. Perspectives of application of such type of organic nonlinear microresonators in optical devices are discussed.},

In this work we demonstrate that in metal nanorod-based HMMs the nonlocality results in fast and slow light effects in the propagation of femtosecond laser pulses in close spectral vicinity of the HMM epsilon-near-zero regime. These effects are switchable via the angle of incidence and light wavelength. We elucidate that revealed dynamical phenomena stem from the zero-transmission points of HMM and related phase singularities caused by the destructive interference of the main optical wave and the additional wave mediated by the spatial dispersion of light in the HMMs.},

Very recently, promising concepts of spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) pulses based on the phase helicity in the space--time coordinates have attracted much attention owing to their donut shape. We elaborate on the molding of STOV under the transmission of femtosecond pulses through a thin epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) metamaterial slab based on a silver nanorod array in a dielectric host. At the heart of the proposed approach is the interference of the so-called main and additional optical waves enabled by strong optical nonlocality of these ENZ metamaterials, which leads to the appearance of phase singularities in transmission spectra. The cascaded metamaterial structure is proposed for high-order STOV generation.},

In periodic systems, it can lead to the Pendell{\"o}sung effect consisting of the energy exchange between diffraction orders.

In this work, we investigate the Pendell{\"o}sung effect in the visible spectral range in two-dimensional photonic crystals (PhCs) with a hexagonal lattice of pores in anodic alumina. We found peculiar spectral and angular variations of the light transmission near the Bragg diffraction conditions and provide a detailed analysis of the effect.},

The diffraction-thick PhC contained 360 spatial periods with a large variation of the refractive index of adjacent layers of 0.4. The experiments reveal switching of the light leaving the PhC between the two spatial directions, which correspond to Laue diffraction maxima, as the fundamental wavelength or polarization of the incident light is varied. A similar effect can be achieved when the temperature of the sample or the intensity of the additional laser beam illuminating the crystal are changed. We show that in our PhC structures, the spectral period of the pendulum effect is down to 5\,nm, while the thermal period is about 10\,{$^\circ$}C.},

  abstract = {The Borrmann effect is the fundamental effect in X-ray physics. It is a strong increase of the transmission of a perfect crystal when the X-rays satisfy the Bragg diffraction condition, originating from X-rays localization between the atomic planes in that case. In other words, the Borrmann effect manifests itself by smaller field losses as the Bragg diffraction law is attained. Following the trend of the transfer of the X-ray phenomena into the optical spectral range, in this work we experimentally observed and studied the optical analog of the Borrmann effect for the case of one-dimensional photonic crystals (PhCs). The studies are performed in the Laue diffraction scheme when no photonic band gaps appear and the light does not experience diffraction-induced light attenuation. We studied the samples of PhCs based on porous fused silica. Samples' manufacturing consists of two stages. First, porous silicon PhCs are fabricated by electrochemical etching of p-doped Si (100) wafer. The PhCs consist of alternating layers of two types, of high and low porosity, characterized by different refractive indexes. The second stage consists in annealing of the crystals in a muffle at 750o C. Depending on the oxidation time, we obtained the PhCs that are partially or fully annealed. The PhCs produced by both techniques have periodical modulation of refractive indexes and losses. Optical losses in the two types of PhCs are different; in partially annealed PhCs (PhC-I) high refractive index layers absorb light due to the presence of residual silicon, while in fully annealed structures (PhC-II) the losses are determined by light scattering in layers with high porosity (low refractive index layers). PhCs have several hundreds of layers that allow study the effect in the Laue scheme of diffraction. Optical experimental setup is based on a CW laser operating at the wavelength of 720-890 nm, its linearly polarized beam is focused by a lens on the PhC input edge of the into a spot of 130 nm. The silicon photodiode with a large detection region is placed close to the PhC output edge, so the total transmission is measured, including the beams of all diffraction maxima. We studied the transmission of the two types of PhCs as a function of the angle of incidence of the radiation. We observe that the transmission of the PhC-I samples demonstrates sharp peaks, corresponding to the Bragg angles of diffraction. The appearance of these peaks manifests of the Borrmann effect due to the predominant localization of the optical field in the PhC layers with low absorption. At the same time, the PhC-II structures demonstrate nearly monotonic decreasing of transmission as a function of the angle of incidence. So the effect is different for the structures with light losses in high or low refractive index layers. Spectral dependence of the effect shows a number of peculiarities: alternating appearance and disappearance of total transmission maxima and a strong angular narrowing of maxima for definite wavelengths. Interrelation of the observed effects with degeneracies of the PhC band structure is confirmed by theoretical calculations.},

  abstract = {Flourish of optics of hyperbolic metamaterials (HMMs) is stimulated by their exotic optical properties. Here, we demonstrate resonant changes of the group retardation and superluminal-like propagation of femtosecond laser pulses in nanorod-based HMMs in the vicinity of epsilon-near-zero spectral point responsible for the transition between topologically distinct elliptic and hyperbolic light dispersions. Resonant dynamics of ultrashort pulses appears in a unique case when their spectral components are in both dispersion regimes simultaneously. Our findings suggest HMMs as a powerful platform for future ultrafast photonics and are pivotal for growing nonlinear optics of hyperbolic media.},

In particular, they sustain resonant light localization near the metal surface resulting in the enhancement of magneto-optical effects and nonlinear optical phenomena, the bridge of which is appealing for sensing and light routing. In this work we investigate the resonant SPP-driven enhancement of the transverse magneto-optical Kerr effect and the second harmonic generation under the conical diffraction of light in a one-dimensional magnetoplasmonic crystal (MPC) based on the combination of gold and ferromagnetic permalloy films. We demonstrate an extra way for the control over the magneto-optical effects in the MPC via the magnetic anisotropy of corrugated ferromagnetic film in the structure of the MPC.},

  abstract = {We present the results of synthesis of arrays of gold and bilayer Au/Ni nanorods in a matrix of porous anodic alumina and of experimental investigation and numerical simulation of their optical and magnetooptical properties. We show that the spectra of these structures have two singular features located near 520 nm and in the range of 700--800 nm. Au/Ni nanorods exhibit a significant modulation and enhancement of the magnetooptical intensity effect in the range of the long-wavelength resonance. Experimentally observed features agree with results of numerical simulation.},

  abstract = {Plasmonic crystals is a class of periodically (nano)- structured materials that reveal a number of artificial resonances associated with the surface plasmon-polariton (SPP) excitation. They are characterized by a resonant enhancement of optical and nonlinear optical effects due to electromagnetic local field amplification [1]. A new route of the development of this area appeared as magnetic materials were introduced as a part of plasmonic crystals, thus forming the magneto-plasmonic crystals (MPC). It was recognized that under the SPP excitation, resonant enhancement of the magneto-optical (MO) effects is achieved as well. Taking into consideration that the SPP resonances are artificial, introduced by the periodicity of the plasmonic crystal, this provides a possibility for the control over MO resonances that is rather prospective for applications. Up to not, two most popular MPC structures were studied, that are made of a combination of a noble (plasmonic) metal and a magnetic dielectric, and surface gratings made of ferromagnetic metals [2]. Here we show that an MPC composed of nanoperforated silver layer covered by a thin permalloy film reveals surface plasmon polariton excitation accompanied by an appearance of the tunable resonance of the magneto-optical response.},

  abstract = {New approaches for the composition of efficient robust plasmonic crystals are very desired for practical applications as well as for the observation of new exciting effects at the nanoscale. Herein, both experimentally and theoretically resonant optical effects in encapsulated magnetoplasmonic crystals composed of a 1D gold grating sandwiched between two layers of iron garnet with slightly different dielectric properties are studied. It is demonstrated that depending on the geometry of the magnetic field application, various mechanisms provide resonant enhancement of the magnetooptical (MO) response of the structure; the strongest MO effect is attained for the case of waveguide modes propagating in iron garnet dielectric layer along the longitudinal magnetic field, when the magnetization-induced rotation of the polarization plane up to a few degrees is observed. The obtained results demonstrate high potential of magnetoplasmonic waveguides as stable and efficient plasmonic devices.},

Optical and nonlinear-optical properties of the structures in the spectral vicinity of these points are investigated. Experimentally observed features are consistent with the data of simulation.},

The wavelength-angular spectra of the 2D crystals reveal a large number of high-quality resonant features associated with the excitation of surface plasmon-polariton modes of various orders. Due to the presence of a ferromagnetic material on both plasmonic interfaces, pronounced magnetic effects are observed for all excitations and are influenced by the coupling between various modes. The suggested magnetoplasmonic crystal composition with high-quality resonant optical and magneto-optical properties gives perspective for the control over the light propagation as well as for sensor applications.},

Up-conversion processes responsible for the transformation of IR laser radiation into visible are intensity-dependent and thus rather sensitive to all involved effects, which can mask each other. In this work we study the phenomena that are the most important for possible lasing in 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-(4-dimethylaminostyryl)-4 H-pyran dye spherical microresonators: the two-photon absorption and photobleaching. Based on the suggested model of the threshold-like dependence of the two-photon luminescence (TPL) on pump power, we demonstrate the role of intensity-dependent photobleaching in the appearance of the TPL and find a good agreement with the experiment. This finding is important for the analysis of lasing in nonlinear dye-based resonators.},

  abstract = {We report on the experimental investigations of the optical second harmonic generation and magnetooptical effects at the second-harmonic frequency in thin films consisting of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials and including exchange-coupled layers, one of which is pinned with an antiferromagnetic layer. The exchange coupling manifests itself in such structures as a shift of the hysteresis loops relative to the zero magnetic field under the linear magnetooptical Kerr effect. We show that this effect appears to a much less extent in the nonlinear magnetooptical Kerr effect at the second harmonic response. The magnetic field dependences of the second harmonic intensity contain a single magnetic hysteresis loop slightly shifted relative to the zero magnetic field and this shift increases with a decrease in the laser pumping radiation power.},

  abstract = {Magnetization-induced effects accompanying optical second harmonic generation (SHG) in three-layer W/Co/Pt films with different thicknesses of the cobalt layer (2--10 nm) induced by longitudinal magnetic field are experimentally studied. An odd-magnetic intensity effect in the p polarized second harmonic is found, with the corresponding SHG magnetic contrast increasing with the thickness of the Co layer SHGSHG. The effects are phenomenologically described by considering the bulk nonlinear polarization at the second harmonic frequency, which is proportional to the magnetization gradient in the direction normal to the structure, and the interface contribution, which is proportional to the square of the magnetization of the films.},

  abstract = {Interfaces between ferromagnetic metals and nonmagnetic specimen attract much attention as they are very important for the formation of magnetic properties of nanostructures. Vice versa, specific magnetic ordering at such interfaces may provide new effects in their optical and nonlinear optical response. In this work we study the magnetization-induced effects in optical second harmonic generation (SHG) in W/Co/Pt-based thin films with the thicknesses of the Co layer of 2-10 nm. Besides common odd in magnetization effects in the SHG intensity, we observe additional one that is not expected for homogeneously magnetized ferromagnetic films, which consists in modulation of p-polarized SHG intensity under longitudinal magnetic field application. The phenomenological description of the observed effect is performed in terms of gradient and second-order in magnetization contributions to the SHG polarization, where gradient of magnetization along the normal to the structure plays the key role.},

  abstract = {High-gain parametric down-conversion (PDC) is inevitably accompanied by cascaded up-conversion (CUpC) of PDC radiation in a nonlinear crystal even if CUpC is nonphase matched. Here we study experimentally and theoretically the spectral properties of broadband phase-matched and nonphase-matched CUpC radiation in a beta barium borate (BBO) crystal. Our calculations of the normalized second-order correlation function predict the super-bunching of CUpC radiation.},

  abstract = {Magnetic field control over the optical switching is demonstrated for a nonlinear all-garnet magnetophotonic crystal with a microcavity (MC) layer possessing both third-order Kerr nonlinearity and magnetooptical activity. A significant enhancement of the effective refractive index of the microcavity layer is observed, that results in the light-induced spectral shift of the MC mode of 2 nm. It is shown that application of the external magnetic field leads to an increase of switching contrast by a factor of two. Possible mechanisms of photorefractive effect involved in the optical switching in all-garnet magnetophotonic crystals are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Here, we propose a design of a chiral periodic metasurface based on plasmonic nanodisks and nanorods arranged asymmetrically in a unit cell. Using the finite-difference time-domain analysis, we show that the collective lattice resonance harnessed by the diffraction coupling of the plasmonic unit cells is the heart of the revealed resonant 38\% circular dichroism effect. The circular dichroism enhancement of the considered structure is improved using the deep-learning-assisted optimization of the metasurface design.},

  abstract = {Photonic crystals (PCs) consisting of a periodic arrangement of holes in dielectric media have found success in light manipulation and sensing. Among them, three-dimensional (3D) PCs are in high demand due to their unique properties originating from multiple photonic band gaps (PBGs) and even full ones. Here, 3D PCs based on porous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) were fabricated for the first time. Our approach involves prepatterning of the aluminum surface by a focused ion beam to form a hexagonal array of pore nuclei. Subsequent anodization in 1 M H3PO3 using a sine wave profile of voltage provides AAO with a defect-free in-plane porous structure and out-of-plane porosity modulation. The ability to tune the position, width, and depth of the PBGs is demonstrated. The combination of the flexibility of the proposed approach with the unique properties of AAO extends the range of practical applications of 3D PCs far beyond the current achievements.},

  abstract = {Phase transitions and switching behaviour in thin (1.5 - 4 mum) planar cells of a ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) mixture are studied by optical second harmonic generation (SHG). A pronounced anisotropy of the SHG response shows a high ordering degree of the FLC molecules in the cells. We studied the electric field-induced switching of the FLC cells and their temperature dependence by means of SHG. This shows the existence of a 10-20 nm thick frozen sub-surface layer of FLC molecules,which cannot be switched by an electric field well above the bulk saturating field and at significantly high temperatures.},

  abstract = {The rate of an n-photon effect generally scales as the nth order autocorrelation function of the incident light, which is high for light with strong photon-number fluctuations. Therefore, ``noisy'' light sources are much more efficient for multiphoton effects than coherent sources with the same mean power, pulse duration, and repetition rate. Here we generate optical harmonics of the order of 2--4 from a bright squeezed vacuum, a state of light consisting of only quantum noise with no coherent component. We observe up to 2 orders of magnitude enhancement in the generation of optical harmonics due to ultrafast photon-number fluctuations. This feature is especially important for the nonlinear optics of fragile structures, where the use of a noisy pump can considerably increase the effect without overcoming the damage threshold.},

  abstract = {Photonic crystals (PC) are periodic structures with a period of about the wavelength of a visible light. The simplest PC is an array periodically alternating dielectric layers of two types. At the Laue geometry (when the light propagates through the PC along the layers) the effects of the dynamical diffraction theory were observed, e.g. pendell{\"o}sung effect and Borrmann effect. It was theoretically predicted that the femtosecond laser pulse at Laue geometry in 1d PC undergoes two consequent splitting: spatial and temporal. The spatial splitting is caused by the dynamical diffraction on the PC lattice and the temporal splitting can be explained as the formation of two spatial modes called borrmann and antiborrmann in a crystal and each of these modes is localized in layers of its own type. Therefore these modes have different group velocities depending on the refraction indices of two layers and these modes will split in time.},

  abstract = {Pendell{\"o}sung effect is the periodic variation of the diffracted beams intensity. It was predicted by the dynamical diffraction theory for the X-ray diffraction. It was experimentally observed for the X-ray, neutron and microwave diffraction. In 2006 it was observed in optical range for the diffraction of light in 3-dimetsional opal photonic crystals. This effect can be used to obtain negative-index materials, for optical switching, Recently the pendell{\"o}sung effect in one-dimensional photonic crystal at Laue geometry was predicted. The considered crystal consists of periodically alternating dielectric layers of two types. The pendell{\"o}sung effect is caused by the formation of two spatial modes called borrmann and antiborrmann in a crystal and each of these modes is localized in layers of its own type. The periodic exchange of energy between these modes occurs. We present the numerical simulation and the experimental observation of this effect in the porous silicon photonic crystal.},

This phenomenon originates from spatially inhomogeneous light localization within the PC at the Laue scheme of the dynamical Bragg diffraction. In a homogenous medium at the PC output each pulse is spatially separated into two pulses, propagating in the transmission and diffraction directions, respectively. The experiments are carried out for one-dimensional porous silicon-based PC consisting of 375 spatial periods of 800 nm thick and using a femtosecond Ti-sapphire laser as a probe. A linear dependence of the time splitting of each pair of transmitted and diffractively reflected pulses on the crystal thickness is demonstrated and is supported by theoretical estimations.},

  abstract = {The polarization effects in the diffraction-induced pulse splitting (DIPS) observed under the dynamical Bragg diffraction in the Laue geometry in linear one-dimensional photonic crystals (PCs) are studied theoretically and experimentally. It is demonstrated that the characteristic length of the laser pulse path in a PC, or splitting length, used to describe the temporal pulse splitting, as well as the number of the outgoing femtosecond pulses, are influenced significantly by the polarization of the incident laser pulse. We have observed that the characteristic splitting time in porous quartz PCs for the s-polarized probe pulse polarization is approximately 1.5 times smaller as compared with that measured for the p-polarized radiation. These results are supported by the theoretical description and ensure that the polarization sensitivity of the DIPS effect is due to a large lattice-induced dispersion of the PC. It is also shown that the number of output pulses can be varied from two up to four in both transmission and diffraction directions depending on the polarization of incident femtosecond pulses.},

  abstract = {Recently the spatial and temporal splitting of short laser pulses passing through the one-dimensional photonic crystal (PC) at Laue geometry was theoretically predicted on the basis of dynamical diffraction theory for X-ray optics Bragg diffraction. This prediction promises the generation of pairs of pulses with separately tunable parameters and delay (which can be used in pump-probe technique) and the periodic variation of the diffracted beams intensity -- pendell{\"o}sung effect (which allows some kinds of optical switching). We present the experimental and numerical studies of the laser pulse propagation in 1d PC at Laue geometry. The diffraction patterns and the multiperiodic pendell{\"o}sung effect were obtained experimentally. All effects including temporal pulse splitting were simulated numerically using the FDTD method for ideal and defect PCs.},

Domain structure of both bulk and interfaces of garnet films is closely connected with their magnetic properties and magnetization dynamics. In this work, we investigate the magnetic behaviour and domain structure of an epitaxial bismuth-substituted lutetium iron garnet film with a regular array of planar submicron particles made of Co film or Co/Pt multilayer on its surface. Optical polarization microscopy and magnetic force microscopy techniques used for the characterization of these composite structures confirm the mutual influence of the garnet and metal nanostructured layers on each other. On the one hand, dense ordered metal particles provide the pinning of the surface magnetic domains of the garnet film, which further affects the organization of the bulk stripe domains. On the other hand, we observed that the domain structure in the metallic pattern is governed by the domain structure of the garnet placed beneath it.},

The R- and S-BP copolymers self-assemble in a tetrahydrofuran/H2O/ethanol mixture producing microspherical particles. Remarkably, the obtained polymer microspheres support excitation of whispering gallery mode resonances (500--720 nm) in one- and two-photon excited luminescence or two-photon luminescence (TPL) with a quality factor (Q ) of up to {$\approx$}700. As a result of a high Q value, a single (R- or S-BP ) microsphere displays a circular dichroism (CD) effect in the TPL signal. At high laser pump-power ({$\geq$}10 mW), the TPL spectral features of microspheres change significantly, suggesting alterations of the polymer packing. Similar spectral variations are observed for microspheres heated thermally or with high power continuous-wave laser. Photoluminescence lifetime imaging microscopy down to the single microsphere level corroborate transformations of polymer packing from a J type to a mixture of J , H , and H-like (with disordered side chains) types. This work demonstrates the tremendous potential of tailor-made chiral polymer microspheres exhibiting multifunctional properties, such as i) light-confinement, ii) NLO-CD, and iii) laser-driven optical emission shifts, useful for many optoelectronic and photonic device applications.},

We have observed a significant role of spin wave modes along the nanorod axis in contrast to infinite magnetic nanowires. Unusual optical properties featuring an inverted Stokes/anti-Stokes asymmetry of the Brillouin scattering spectra have been observed. The spectrum of spin wave modes in the nanorod array has been calculated and compared with the experiment. Experimental observations are explained in terms of a combined numerical-analytical approach taking into account both the low aspect ratio of individual magnetic nanorods and dipolar magnetic coupling between the nanorods in the array. The optical studies of spin-wave modes in the metamaterials with low aspect ratio nanorods have revealed new magnetic and magneto-optical properties compared to continuous magnetic films or infinite magnetic nanowires. Such magnetic metamaterials are important class of active metamaterials needed for prospective data storage and signal processing applications. (c) 2012 Optical Society of America},

  abstract = {Chiro-optical signals from chiral molecules/structures are inherently weak. In particular, enhancing the circular-dichroism (CD) effect (different absorption of left or right circularly polarized light) in the non-linear optical (NLO) signal from chiral molecular materials is challenging and imperative since it is advantageous in various areas, from biomedical sciences to miniaturized photonic devices. Here we suggest and realize for the first time an approach to enhance the CD effect taking advantage of the NLO effects resonantly enhanced in the nonlinear chiral organic micro-resonators. These R- and S-type resonators in the form of micro-spheres are prepared by the self-assembly technique from the corresponding axially chiral enantiomeric molecules, namely R- and S-4-[2,2{$\prime$}-diethoxy-6{$\prime$}-(4-formylphenyl)-[1,1{$\prime$}-binaphthalen]-6-yl]benzaldehyde in CHCl3/MeOH mixtures. Each enantiomeric micro-sphere, upon optical pumping, acts as a whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonator as the photo-luminescence (PL) is excited in a single- or in a two-photon regime. We show that the NLO-CD effect and the two-photon absorption (TPA) in the case of micro-spheres are at least twice as high as compared to a continuous film of the same effective thickness. This is due to pronounced field localization effects in micro-spheres with high Q-factor, which increases the photon residence time ({$\tau$}P) in a chiral medium and thus strengthens the light--matter interaction. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) numerical calculations confirm a strong light localization near the boundary of the micro-spheres.},

Perylene dye is one of the celebrated near-direct bandgap NLO materials. It crystallizes in two distinctive polymorphic forms (square-shaped, {$\alpha$}, and rhombus-shaped, {$\beta$}) emitting yellow and green fluorescence, respectively. However, selective access to any one of the polymorphic microcrystals possessing qualities such as smooth-surface and mirror-like light-reflecting sharp edges is a challenging task. On the other hand, these qualities are indispensable for a microcrystal to operate as an optical cavity. Here, a cost-effective and straightforward, yet promising sublimation technique to grow microscale perylene crystals with the above qualities in a polymorph-selective manner at ambient pressure is presented. As a result, both polymorphic microcrystals act as whispering gallery mode (WGM) cavities in the linear and notably, NLO regime as well. In agreement with the experiments, finite difference time domain numerical calculations support the WGM-cavity-type and also reveal the intricate localization of electric-field within these cavities. Further, the quadratic dependence of emission intensity as a function of laser power establishes the two-photon absorption nature of the optical cavities pumped by infrared lasers.},
