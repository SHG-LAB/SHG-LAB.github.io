The effects of the second- and third-harmonics generation as well as nonlinear magneto-optical Faraday and Kerr effects are reviewed. The main magnetic ma- terial used in the MPC structures, which determines the magneto-optical activity of the magnetophotonic structures, is yttrium‚Äìiron garnet (YIG), which appears as a continuous layer in 1D MPC, microcavity layer in magnetophotonic microcavities or YIG nanoparticles incorporated in artificial opal structure. We demonstrate that many-fold amplification of the nonlinear magneto-optical effects is attained within the spectral edge of the photonic band gap and within the microcavity mode as compared to linear magneto-optical analogs. Strong light localization as well as the realization of the phase matching conditions are discussed as possible mechanisms of the observed enhancement of the nonlinear magneto-optical effects.},

Here, we present a simple remedy to cure this innate flaw. We found that preliminary chirping of the laser pulse prevents the STOV breakup.

In this work, we investigate the Pendell√∂sung effect in the visible spectral range in two-dimensional photonic crystals (PhCs) with a hexagonal lattice of pores in anodic alumina. We found peculiar spectral and angular variations of the light transmission near the Bragg diffraction conditions and provide a detailed analysis of the effect.},

Here we study the magnetization-induced optical second-harmonic generation in its relation to the magnetization dynamics induced in bilayer ferromagnetic/heavy metal nanofilms by the magnetic field of an intense femtosecond laser pulse. We show the appearance of odd in magnetization intensity effect in the second-harmonic generation (SHG), which correlates with the damping of the magnetization oscillations at the optical wave frequency as was predicted quite recently. The efficiency of the effect is of a few percent as compared to the nonmagnetic SHG and is the most pronounced for the so-called ‚Äúforbidden‚Äù SHG geometry, i.e., for the ùëù-polarized incident and reflected waves in the longitudinal magnetization scheme. This magnetization-dynamics-induced SHG contribution is shown to be anisotropic, sensitive to the angle of incidence of the probe beam, and is the largest for the CoPt films due to the maximum Gilbert damping constant.},

	abstract = {Porous anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) is widely used as a template for the electrodeposition of ordered arrays of one-dimensional nanostructures. Prior to template filling, the barrier layer, which blocks the pores at their bases, should be removed. However, the increase in AAO porosity during wet-chemical etching of the barrier layer is unavoidable that can limit further application of the templates. In this study, we report the kinetics of ion beam etching of the AAO barrier layer and the application of the technique for preparing AAO templates with the lowest possible porosity: 8\% for the AAO films obtained in 0.3 M oxalic acid at 40 V. The fabrication of Au nanorod-based hyperbolic metamaterials (HMMs) with a certain spectral position of epsilon-near-zero point is demonstrated. Transmission spectra measurement and simulation give self-consistent values of gold volume fraction in the range from 7.3\% to 8.4\% confirming the high reproducibility of the proposed technique for AAO barrier layer etching. Such low volume fraction of metal makes Au nanorod-based HMMs promising candidates for the use in nanophotonic devices with tunable properties that are sensitive to the geometrical parameters of the structural elements. HMMs prepared using templates after chemical etching of the barrier layer possess a higher metal volume fraction and demonstrate a weaker dependence of the ENZ position on the nanorod length.},

	abstract = {Control over the magnetic domain structure of garnet films is an important task thatis attractive for a wide range of applications. One of the possible approaches here is based on the introduction of additional structured magnetic coverages interacting with the garnet layer. Inthis study, we demonstrate that arrays of asymmetric ferromagnetic cobalt particles regularly arranged on the surface of Lu,Bi-substituted iron garnet film influence the orientation and width of the stripe domains, as stems from the optical microscopy, magneto-optical and diffraction studies. We also show that triangular-shaped Co particles induce the asymmetry of the magnetic field dependence on the magneto-optical Kerr effect of the composite structure. We assert that the key effect here is the interaction of the residual magnetic moments of Co particles with thesurface closure domains.},

Domain structure of both bulk and interfaces of garnet films is closely connected with their magnetic properties and magnetization dynamics. In this work, we investigate the magnetic behaviour and domain structure of an epitaxial bismuth-substituted lutetium iron garnet film with a regular array of planar submicron particles made of Co film or Co/Pt multilayer on its surface. Optical polarization microscopy and magnetic force microscopy techniques used for the characterization of these composite structures confirm the mutual influence of the garnet and metal nanostructured layers on each other. On the one hand, dense ordered metal particles provide the pinning of the surface magnetic domains of the garnet film, which further affects the organization of the bulk stripe domains. On the other hand, we observed that the domain structure in the metallic pattern is governed by the domain structure of the garnet placed beneath it.},

This is especially important in connection with the development of modern technologies, which allow the creation of structures with fundamentally new magnetic and optical properties, whose realization is impossible in natural materials. The review presents the results of research on nonlinear optical effects in ferromagnetic nano- and microstructures, as well as films of different compositions. The unique possibilities of nonlinear optical diagnostics of anisotropic, vortex, and exchange-biased magnetic structures, visualization of the micromagnetic structure of surface layers of iron‚Äìgarnets are demonstrated. The exceptional effectiveness of these approaches is based both on the high sensitivity of the method of optical second harmonic generations to the magnetic state of nanostructures and interfaces, and on the properties of symmetry of tensors of high-order magnetizationinduced susceptibility.},

Optical third harmonic generation (THG) is mostly known by its applications in investigation of biological structures, while magneto-optical effects in THG are not well recognized. Here we demonstrate high efficiency of the THG probe in studies of magnetic domain structure of epitaxial garnet films. We show that in spite of relatively small values of the magneto-optical effect at the THG wavelength, the THG microscopy may be efficient for the characterization of magnetic surface domains if the THG wavelength falls in the absorption band of a medium. Moreover, the in-depth sensitivity of this probe may be higher as compared to the case of the second harmonic generation microscopy.},

Among them, three-dimensional (3D) PCs are in high demand due to their unique properties originating from multiple photonic band gaps (PBGs) and even full ones. Here, 3D PCs based on porous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) were fabricated for the first time. Our approach involves prepatterning of the aluminum surface by a focused ion beam to form a hexagonal array of pore nuclei. Subsequent anodization in 1 M H3PO3 using a sine wave profile of voltage provides AAO with a defect-free in-plane porous structure and out-of-plane porosity modulation. The ability to tune the position, width, and depth of the PBGs is demonstrated. The combination of the flexibility of the proposed approach with the unique properties of AAO extends the range of practical applications of 3D PCs far beyond the current achievements.},

Mainly, tunable second-harmonic generation (SHG) with continuous-wave (CW) pump sources is considered as breakthrough technology for optical switching, actuation, sensing, chip-integrated coherent light sources, and low-threshold tunable microlasers. Here, the discovery of tunable CW SHG in a polar (non-centrosymmetric) electro-mechanical microcrystal cavity of 4-(4-(methylthio)phenyl)-2,6-di(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine (UOH1) is demonstrated. As a result of total internal reflection in mirror-like light-reflecting facets and its high second-order nonlinear susceptibility, the octahedron-shaped cavities exhibit both bright femtosecond and CW-pumped SHG with coherent whispering gallery mode (WGM) and bow-tie-like (BT) optical modes excited in its spectrum. Moreover, for an external dc electric field of about 23 kV cm‚àí1 the microcavity displays 0.18 nm resonant wavelength peak shift in the second harmonic signal due to electrostriction (strain effect).},

Using the finite-difference time-domain analysis, we show that the collective lattice resonance harnessed by the diffraction coupling of the plasmonic unit cells is the heart of the revealed resonant 38\% circular dichroism effect. The circular dichroism enhancement of the considered structure is improved using the deep-learning-assisted optimization of the metasurface design.},

A significant modulation of optical second harmonic generation intensity along stripe domains is detected near the free film surface. This modulation is caused by periodic distortions of the stripe domain structure near the film surface and the presence of surface closure domains detected by magnetic force microscopy (MFM). A series of MFM images of the film taken in an in-plane magnetic field varying from ‚Äì400 to 400 Oe demonstrates quasi-static nucleation of closure domains periodically located along stripe domains.},

We demonstrate that the nonsymmetric elongated shape of planar nanoparticles along with the strong light localization effects result in the enhancement of the NLO response, including SHG and two-photon fluorescence. We also demonstrate that the efficiency of the SHG in nanoparticles is rather sensitive to the polarization of the incident laser beam, the visibility of the nanostructures in the nonlinear microscopy images being the highest for the linear polarization of the laser beam.},

We elaborate on the molding of STOV under the transmission of femtosecond pulses through a thin epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) metamaterial slab based on a silver nanorod array in a dielectric host. At the heart of the proposed approach is the interference of the so-called main and additional optical waves enabled by strong optical nonlocality of these ENZ metamaterials, which leads to the appearance of phase singularities in transmission spectra. The cascaded metamaterial structure is proposed for high-order STOV generation.},

It manifests itself as a widening and shift of the magnetic hysteresis loop with respect to zero value of the external magnetic field oriented along the pinning direction. In this work, we report on comparative studies of linear and nonlinear magneto-optical effects under the laser-induced switching of the pinning effect in IrMn/CoFe films of various thickness of the ferromagnetic CoFe layer. We found that the magneto-optical response of the pinned AFM/FM nanofilms appears with different hysteresis loop parameters in the transverse magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) and interface-sensitive magnetization-induced second harmonic generation (SHG), indicating the diversity of the magnetic effects at interfaces compared to the bulk of the films.},

The experimental configuration features the MBR as both the vial containing the suspension and the optical transducer, allowing for a sensitive ultra-compact system with a straightforward microfluidic integration. With respect to a previous publication, the active lock of the MBR resonance produced an order-of-magnitude improvement in the system performance and a smooth absorption reconstruction. Additionally, since the detection process is temperature-based, the measurement is intrinsically insensitive towards scattering spectrum, both of the particles and of the host liquid. These features make the MBR system an interesting candidate for the characterisation of extremely small samples in the context of medical diagnosis from whole biological samples, quality controls for food safety or chemical production processes, and, in general, for the measurement of absorption in opaque mediums.},

The capabilities of optimized two-photon laser lithography are demonstrated by examples of ring microcavities and optical waveguides with prism input/output adapters located above a substrate.

We show that this effect appears to a much less extent in the nonlinear magnetooptical Kerr effect at the second harmonic response. The magnetic field dependences of the second harmonic intensity contain a single magnetic hysteresis loop slightly shifted relative to the zero magnetic field and this shift increases with a decrease in the laser pumping radiation power.},

These effects are switchable via the angle of incidence and light wavelength. We elucidate that revealed dynamical phenomena stem from the zero-transmission points of HMM and related phase singularities caused by the destructive interference of the main optical wave and the additional wave mediated by the spatial dispersion of light in the HMMs.},

As examples that clearly demonstrate the possibilities of the SHG method for examining nonstandard objects of nonlinear optics, we discuss the behaviour of the nonlinear optical response of single-crystal silicon and germanium surfaces and their interfaces with oxides, as well as nonlinear electroreflection. Optical interferometry and its possibilities are briefly described using the example of these systems. Unique sensitivity of SHG to the symmetry and resonance properties of nanostructures, including magnetic ones, is shown, which determines the efficiency of this method for investigating such systems. Finally, we demonstrate that the SHG effect is a unique remote and sensitive method for studying ferroelectric structures.},

In this work, the properties of microcavity structures obtained by the indicated method from hybrid polymers with addition of various dyes have been studied. The possibility of formation of high-quality microstructures from activated polymers, conservation of their luminescent properties after polymerization under intense laser irradiation, and reduction of the exposure of two-photon laser lithography by two orders of magnitude in the presence of Coumarin-1 dye has been demonstrated. The nonlinear optical microscopy study has shown that the spatial distribution of scattered fluorescence in microcavity structures based on the polymer with the dye corresponds to the excitation of cavity modes or whispering gallery modes.},

	abstract = {Magnetic nanostructures reveal unique interface induced properties that differ from those of bulk materials, thus magnetization distributions in interface regions are of high interest. Meanwhile, direct measurement of magnetization distribution in layered nanostructures is a complicated task. Here we study magnetic field induced effects in optical second harmonic generation (SHG) in three-layer ferromagnetic / heavy metals nano films. For a certain experimental geometry, which excludes the appearance of magnetooptical effects for homogeneously magnetized structures, magnetization induced SHG intensity variation is observed. Symmetry analysis of the SHG intensity dependencies on external magnetic field shows that the nonlinear source terms proportional to the out-of-plane gradient component of magnetization govern the observed effect.},

Hyperbolic metamaterials (HMMs) based on ordered arrays of metal nanorods embedded in a dielectric matrix are of great interest due to their nontrivial optical properties and abilities to control over the parameters of light. In this article, we present the results of nonlinear absorbtion measurements in HMMs based on ordered arrays of silver nanorods. The main finding consists in the spectral vicinity of Epsilon-Near-Zero and Epsilon-Near-Pole features.},

	abstract = {The ability to manipulate the frequency of light is a cornerstone of a wide range of applications in photonics expanding spectral ranges of the light sources. To boost the second harmonic generation efficiency, intense efforts toward exploiting artificial microstructures for frequency doubling were carried out. The sought-after approach of utilizing photonic crystals is inspired by their unusual light dispersion. In such structures, the dynamics of the field of femtosecond laser pulses is of paramount importance for frequency conversion. In this work, we investigate the phase-matched second harmonic generation under the effect of diffraction-induced femtosecond laser pulse splitting in one-dimensional photonic crystals at the Bragg diffraction in the Laue geometry. We demonstrate that the interaction of the two pulses at the fundamental frequency that appears in photonic crystals through the dynamical light diffraction leads to a nonmonotonic dependence of the frequency up-conversion efficiency with respect to the laser pulse duration, thus allowing to increase the second harmonic power by tuning the pulse duration.},

Wefound that the structural asymmetry leads to the increase of the averaged SHG intensity, as well asto the magnetic field-induced effects in SHG. Moreover, by choosing the proper geometry of theexperiment, we excluded the most studied linear in magnetization SHG contributions and, thus,succeeded in studying higher order in magnetization and non-local magnetic effects. We revealedodd in magnetization SHG effects consistent with the phenomenological description involving inhomogeneous (gradient) magnetization distribution at interfaces and found them quite pronounced, sothat they should be necessarily taken into account when analyzing the non-linear magneto-opticalresponse of nanostructures.},

One of the most promising tools for tuning the optical properties of metamaterials in situ is the application of an external magnetic field. However, for the case of HMM based on the ordered arrays of magneto-plasmonic nanostructures, this effect has not been clearly demonstrated until now. In this paper, we present the results of synthesis of HMM based on the highly-ordered arrays of bisegmented Au/Ni nanorods in porous anodic alumina templates and a detailed study of their optical and magneto-optical properties. Distinct enhancement of the magneto-optical (MO) effects along with their sign reversal is observed in the spectral vicinity of epsilon-near-zero and epsilon-near-pole spectral regions. The underlying mechanism is the amplification of the MO polarization plane rotation initiated by Ni segments followed by the light propagation in a strongly birefringent HMM. This stays in agreement with the phenomenological description and relevant numerical calculations.},

In turn, the spectrum of the plasmon excitations can be controlled by external magnetic field, thus giving rise to magnetoplasmonics. However, in the case of traditional magnetoplasmonic structures, the enhancement of magneto-optical (MO) effects is often accompanied by the transmission damp, which constricts the area of their applications. This paper examines resonant optical effects in composite structures based on artificial opal films covered by a thin cobalt layer, which forms a 2D hexagonal lattice of nanoholes in the metal film. Such periodic structure exhibits surface plasmon polariton-assisted extraordinary transmission along with the increase of odd in magnetization intensity magnetooptical effect in the Voigt geometry. Local field enhancement accompanying the surface plasmon polaritons excitation in composite Co/opal structure provides a distinct enhancement of the magnetization-induced second harmonic generation (SHG) and relevant MO effects at the SHG wavelength that appear as Fano-type resonances. High transmission along with resonantly-high MO effects make Co/opal films promising in plasmonic applications.},

We observed the enhancement of the MO effect of up to 0.6\% in the spectral vicinity of the SPP excitation, and several times less strong effect close to the PBG, while the combined appearance of PBG and SPP decreases the resultant MO response.

	abstract = {Highly pure, organic, crystalline materials with nonlinear optical (NLO) properties are in great demand due to their potential to be utilized in miniaturized nanophotonic device applications. Perylene dye is one of the celebrated near-direct bandgap NLO materials. It crystallizes in two distinctive polymorphic forms (square-shaped, Œ±, and rhombus-shaped, Œ≤) emitting yellow and green fluorescence, respectively. However, selective access to any one of the polymorphic microcrystals possessing qualities such as smooth-surface and mirror-like light-reflecting sharp edges is a challenging task. On the other hand, these qualities are indispensable for a microcrystal to operate as an optical cavity. Here, a cost-effective and straightforward, yet promising sublimation technique to grow microscale perylene crystals with the above qualities in a polymorph-selective manner at ambient pressure is presented. As a result, both polymorphic microcrystals act as whispering gallery mode (WGM) cavities in the linear and notably, NLO regime as well. In agreement with the experiments, finite difference time domain numerical calculations support the WGM-cavity-type and also reveal the intricate localization of electric-field within these cavities. Further, the quadratic dependence of emission intensity as a function of laser power establishes the two-photon absorption nature of the optical cavities pumped by infrared lasers.},

Here we study experimentallyresonant multiphoton processes in spherical microresonators with the diameter of 2‚Äì12 Œºmmade of 1,1‚Äô-bi-2-naphthol derivatives by a self-assembly technique. Using nonlinear singleparticlemicroscopy, we demonstrate that these microspheres provide excitation of whisperinggallery modes (WGMs) in two- and three-photon excited luminescence with a Q-factor ofup to 300. We also demonstrate that the nonlinear circular dichroism is enhanced due tothe WGM excitation and reaches 7.7\% and 11\% in the two- and three-photon absorption,respectively. Pronounced modulation of the WGMs spectrum due to the mode‚Äôs splitting isobserved in coupled binol-based microresonators, which opens a path for the control over theirresonant response and makes them suitable for nonlinear optical sensing applications.},

	abstract = {Micro- and nanostructuring of optical media is the cornerstone for a wide range of applications in optics. Artificial structures significantly enrich the interaction of light with dielectrics and metals and are harnessed to reveal exciting optical effects. Recently hypercrystals were proposed as intriguing class of periodic structures bringing together hyperbolic dispersion law of hyperbolic metamaterials and the Bragg diffraction. In this work we proposed the finite-difference frequency-domain method for modeling of light diffraction in these highly anisotropic structures. The method is suitable for one- and two-dimensional gratings as well as multilayer gratings made of anisotropic materials. Developed approach gives advantages over the finite-difference time-domain method (FDTD) and rigorous-coupled mode analysis (RCWA) widely used for calculation of light diffraction in gratings. Proposed method eliminates evaluation of time dynamics and discretization of whole volume of a structure as the FDTD does. Instead, Yee‚Äôs mesh of the cross section of the unit cell of grating is involved. As well information about the Bloch modes of the field inside the structure inaccessible directly for the FDTD is obtained. We used of values of electromagnetic field in mesh nodes instead Fourier series applied in the RCWA to overcome difficulties of the RCWA for high contrast and highly anisotropic structures as hypercrystals. Using the proposed numerical approach, we demonstrate that interface of one-dimensional hypercrystals formed by ridges of hyperbolic metamaterial can support excitation of the Dyakonov plasmons, which merge the Dyakonov waves supported by the interface of birefringent crystal and surface plasmon polaritons in metals.},

It is shown that the rotation of the polarization plane of the second-harmonic wave in the longitudinal magneto-optical Kerr effect configuration is as large as 37{\textbackslash}circ, which corresponds to a relative contribution from the magnetic field induced component of the second-harmonic field of about 30\% and significantly exceeds the magnitude of the same effect for Co/Pt bilayer structures. It is shown that magnetization reversal in the Ta/Co/Pt structure occurs via the rotation of the magnetization vector within the film plane, and its direction is determined by the orientation of the easy magnetization axis of the structure relative to the applied field. The odd in magnetization contribution is experimentally observed in the intensity of the second harmonic in the longitudinal Kerr effect geometry, although it is forbidden by symmetry for the surfaces of uniformly magnetized structures.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear microresonators are very desired for a wide variety of applications. Up-conversion processes responsible for the transformation of IR laser radiation into visible are intensity-dependent and thus rather sensitive to all involved effects, which can mask each other. In this work we study the phenomena that are the most important for possible lasing in 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-(4-dimethylaminostyryl)-4 H-pyran dye spherical microresonators: the two-photon absorption and photobleaching. Based on the suggested model of the threshold-like dependence of the two-photon luminescence (TPL) on pump power, we demonstrate the role of intensity-dependent photobleaching in the appearance of the TPL and find a good agreement with the experiment. This finding is important for the analysis of lasing in nonlinear dye-based resonators.},

The R‚Äê and S‚ÄêBP copolymers self‚Äêassemble in a tetrahydrofuran/H2O/ethanol mixture producing microspherical particles. Remarkably, the obtained polymer microspheres support excitation of whispering gallery mode resonances (500‚Äì720 nm) in one‚Äê and two‚Äêphoton excited luminescence or two‚Äêphoton luminescence (TPL) with a quality factor (Q ) of up to ‚âà700. As a result of a high Q value, a single (R‚Äê or S‚ÄêBP ) microsphere displays a circular dichroism (CD) effect in the TPL signal. At high laser pump‚Äêpower (‚â•10 mW), the TPL spectral features of microspheres change significantly, suggesting alterations of the polymer packing. Similar spectral variations are observed for microspheres heated thermally or with high power continuous‚Äêwave laser. Photoluminescence lifetime imaging microscopy down to the single microsphere level corroborate transformations of polymer packing from a J type to a mixture of J , H , and H‚Äêlike (with disordered side chains) types. This work demonstrates the tremendous potential of tailor‚Äêmade chiral polymer microspheres exhibiting multifunctional properties, such as i) light‚Äêconfinement, ii) NLO‚ÄêCD, and iii) laser‚Äêdriven optical emission shifts, useful for many optoelectronic and photonic device applications.},

Strong increase of the SHG intensity in the vicinity of the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) spectral point accompanied by dramatic phase modulation of the SHG wave is revealed.

Here we study the effects in the polarization state of light passing through a nanocomposite material consisting of Au nanorods in porous alumina and a similar structure supplemented by a nanolayer of ferromagnetic nickel. We demonstrate that close to the epsilon-near-zero dispersion point, under the transition to the hyperbolic dispersion region, the nanocomposites reveal anomalously high modulation of the polarization state of light, which appears as polarization plane rotation and ellipticity changes of probing radiation with a zero ellipticity. This effect is applied for the giant enhancement of the Faraday effect in a continuous ferromagnetic film staying in contact with hyperbolic material. These findings open a path for the design of polarization state control by using hyperbolic metamaterials.},

	abstract = {We present experimental and theoretical studies of the anomalous high transmission of light (the Borrmann effect) under the Laue diffraction in a one-dimensional photonic crystal (PhC) characterized by spatial modulation of both refractive index and absorption. We show that a strong modulation of the refractive index along with the large PhC period provide new features of the Borrmann effect as compared to the well-known x-ray Borrmann effect in crystals appearing in PhC wavelength-angular transmission spectra. Namely, the maximal transmission is attained at the Bragg angles of incidence and corresponds alternatively to even or odd orders of the Bragg angles depending on the light wavelength. Second, a dramatic decrease of the angular width of the high transmission areas in the spectrum appear near the diabolic points. According to our description, this effect can be treated as a result of the topological phase transition accompanied by exchange of the parity of spatial distribution of the electromagnetic field of the two eigenmodes experiencing degeneracy. We demonstrate that these peculiarities are inherent to the PhC with the optical losses located in layers with higher refractive index, and disappear if the losses are specific for the PhC layers with lower refractive index. The suggested underlying mechanism involves the contribution of the waveguide PhC modes to the PhC transmission spectra.},

Here we report on the synthesis of benzylammonium lead iodide (BALI) perovskite microcrystals made via antisolvent diffusion method. The use of polystyrene (PS) matrix helps the growth of environmentally stable BALI nanocrystals as a result of polymer capping. Optimization of the ratio of BALI-PS during the self-assembly process leads to the formation of defect-free composite microspheres. Further, these BALI crystals act as an active material within the microsphere resonators that display whispering gallery modes (WGM). These WGMs are responsible for high optical storage energy of resonators evidenced by their Q-factor as high as ‚àº1180. Two-dimensional finite difference time-domain calculation shows the concentration of the electric field near the microspheres boundary within a small mode volume of 1.83 Œºm3. Remarkably, BALI-PS composite microresonators and their neat crystals exhibit brilliant two-photon luminescence upon excitation by the infrared fundamental radiation. This simplistic microresonators fabrication technique provides a route toward low-cost nonlinear optical microlasers and other optical energy devices useful for various applications.},

In the absence of magnetization, the value of the SHG CD effect averaged over 2œÄ azimuthal angle is zero, while up to 6\% averaged SHG CD appears as the dc magnetic field is applied along the symmetry axis of the structure. Importantly the averaged SHG CD effect changes its sign under the reversal of the magnetic field, which corresponds to the appearance of magnetization driven true chirality in an array of symmetric magnetic nanostructures.},

	abstract = {We propose non-phase-matched sum frequency generation (SFG) as a method for characterizing broadband multimode light. Both the central wavelength and the bandwidth are in this case not limited by the phase matching condition. As an example, we consider bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) generated through high-gain parametric down conversion (PDC). In the spectrum of SFG from BSV, we observe the coherent peak and the incoherent background. We show that the ratio of their widths is equal to the number of frequency modes in BSV, which in the case of low-gain PDC gives the degree of frequency entanglement for photon pairs. By generating the sum frequency in the near-surface region of a nonlinear crystal, we increase the SFG efficiency and get rid of the modulation caused by chromatic dispersion, known as Maker fringes. This allows one to use non-phasematched SFG as a wavelength-independent autocorrelator. Furthermore, we demonstrate efficient non-phase-matched three- and four-frequency summation of broadband multimode light, hardly possible under phase matching. We show that the latter contains the coherent peak while the former does not.},

	abstract = {Porous films of anodic aluminum oxide are widely used as templates for the electrochemical preparation of functional nanocomposites containing ordered arrays of anisotropic nanostructures. In these structures, the volume fraction of the inclusion phase, which strongly determines the functional properties of the nanocomposite, is equal to the porosity of the initial template. For the range of systems, the most pronounced effects and the best functional properties are expected when the volume fraction of metal is less than 10\%, whereas the porosity of anodic aluminum oxide typically exceeds this value. In the present work, the possibility of the application of anodic aluminum oxide for obtaining hyperbolic metamaterials in the form of nanocomposites with the metal volume fraction smaller than the template porosity is demonstrated for the first time. A decrease in the fraction of the pores accessible for electrodeposition is achieved by controlled blocking of the portion of pores during anodization when the template is formed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been shown in the example of obtaining nanocomposites containing Au nanorods arrays. The possibility for the control over the position of the resonance absorption band corresponding to the excitation of collective longitudinal oscillations of the electron gas in the nanorods in a wide range of wavelengths by controlled decreasing of the metal volume fraction, is shown.},

            A two‚Äêphoton pumped non‚Äêlinear optical (NLO) Fabry‚ÄêP√®rot (F‚ÄêP) type organic micro‚Äêcrystal resonator useful for a myriad of upconversion‚Äêbased light technologies is presented. The resonator is parallelepiped‚Äêshaped and composed of a self‚Äêassembled donor‚Äêacceptor‚Äêdonor type molecule namely, 9,9,9‚Äù,9‚Äù‚Äêtetramethyl‚Äê9H,9‚ÄôH,9‚ÄùH‚Äê[2,‚Äâ2‚Äô:7,2‚Äù‚Äêterfluoren]‚Äê9‚Äô‚Äêone (TTO). X‚Äêray crystal structure of an orange‚Äêyellow TTO micro‚Äêcrystal reveals C‚àíH‚ãÖ‚ãÖ‚ãÖO type weak intermolecular hydrogen bond between the oxygen atom of the fluorenone unit and fluorine hydrogen atom. For one‚Äê and two‚Äêphoton excitation the micro‚Äêcrystals exhibit F‚ÄêP type modes in their photoluminescence signal. The fundamental frequency‚Äêdependent NLO intensity shows a continuous increase as the fundamental wavelength is decreasing down to 770‚ÄÖnm. The two‚Äêphoton luminescence signals from these micro‚Äêresonators are several orders of magnitude higher than the thin films of similar thickness.},

	abstract = {Plasmonic crystals is a class of periodically (nano)- structured materials that reveal a number of artificial resonances associated with the surface plasmon-polariton (SPP) excitation. They are characterized by a resonant enhancement of optical and nonlinear optical effects due to electromagnetic local field amplification [1]. A new route of the development of this area appeared as magnetic materials were introduced as a part of plasmonic crystals, thus forming the magneto-plasmonic crystals (MPC). It was recognized that under the SPP excitation, resonant enhancement of the magneto-optical (MO) effects is achieved as well. Taking into consideration that the SPP resonances are artificial, introduced by the periodicity of the plasmonic crystal, this provides a possibility for the control over MO resonances that is rather prospective for applications. Up to not, two most popular MPC structures were studied, that are made of a combination of a noble (plasmonic) metal and a magnetic dielectric, and surface gratings made of ferromagnetic metals [2]. Here we show that an MPC composed of nanoperforated silver layer covered by a thin permalloy film reveals surface plasmon polariton excitation accompanied by an appearance of the tunable resonance of the magneto-optical response.},

Absorption is introduced by a small amount of silicon in partially annealed porous silicon PhC. We show that the PhC transmittance increases substantially under the Bragg diffraction condition, which is a manifestation of the Borrmann effect. The observed effects along with their polarization sensitivity are confirmed by numerical calculations.},

	abstract = {Chiro-optical signals from chiral molecules/structures are inherently weak. In particular, enhancing the circular-dichroism (CD) effect (different absorption of left or right circularly polarized light) in the non-linear optical (NLO) signal from chiral molecular materials is challenging and imperative since it is advantageous in various areas, from biomedical sciences to miniaturized photonic devices. Here we suggest and realize for the first time an approach to enhance the CD effect taking advantage of the NLO effects resonantly enhanced in the nonlinear chiral organic micro-resonators. These R- and S-type resonators in the form of micro-spheres are prepared by the self-assembly technique from the corresponding axially chiral enantiomeric molecules, namely R- and S-4-[2,2‚Ä≤-diethoxy-6‚Ä≤-(4-formylphenyl)-[1,1‚Ä≤-binaphthalen]-6-yl]benzaldehyde in CHCl3/MeOH mixtures. Each enantiomeric micro-sphere, upon optical pumping, acts as a whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonator as the photo-luminescence (PL) is excited in a single- or in a two-photon regime. We show that the NLO-CD effect and the two-photon absorption (TPA) in the case of micro-spheres are at least twice as high as compared to a continuous film of the same effective thickness. This is due to pronounced field localization effects in micro-spheres with high Q-factor, which increases the photon residence time (œÑP) in a chiral medium and thus strengthens the light‚Äìmatter interaction. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) numerical calculations confirm a strong light localization near the boundary of the micro-spheres.},

This is associated with a strong light localization in microstructures composed of high refractive index material. The TPF and SHG power dependencies show that the observed effects are governed by high second-order nonlinearity of the dye damped by a strong absorption.

Therefore, ‚Äúnoisy‚Äù light sources are much more efficient for multiphoton effects than coherent sources with the same mean power, pulse duration, and repetition rate. Here we generate optical harmonics of the order of 2‚Äì4 from a bright squeezed vacuum, a state of light consisting of only quantum noise with no coherent component. We observe up to 2 orders of magnitude enhancement in the generation of optical harmonics due to ultrafast photon-number fluctuations. This feature is especially important for the nonlinear optics of fragile structures, where the use of a noisy pump can considerably increase the effect without overcoming the damage threshold.},

In this work we discuss the linear, second- and third-order nonlinear optical effects in arrays and in individual organic microstructures composed by self-assembling technique and formed randomly on top of a solid substrate. The structures under study consist of micro-spheres, -hemispheres or -frustums made of red laser dye and reveal an intense fluorescence (FL) in the visible spectral range. Importantly, that due to a high value of the refractive index and confined geometry, such micro-structures support the excitation of whispering gallery modes (WGM), which brings about strong and spectrally-selected light localization. We show that an amplification of the nonlinear optical effects is observed for these structures as compared to a homogeneous dye film of similar composition. The obtained data are in agreement with the results of the FDTD calculations performed for the structures of different dimensions. Perspectives of application of such type of organic nonlinear microresonators in optical devices are discussed.},

A special place here belongs to chiral nanostructures that could compete with the natural materials both in efficiency and size of functional elements. For the case of metamaterials, optical activity originates from a special shape of the elements and their arrangement within an array. This research field has been actively developing over the last years and significant values of chirality effects were observed in the linear-optical response of metallic nanostructures [1]. Furthermore, chirality effects are more pronounced in the nonlinear-optical response of such structures [2,3], the latter being governed to a great extent by the local field distribution inside the metal nanostructures. In this talk we will focus mostly on the recent results on the linear and nonlinear optical effects in planar arrays of chiral nanostructures with the shape of a flat spiral (G-shaped nanostructures).},

The underlying mechanisms are commonly discussed in terms of local field effects and formation of localized SHG sources (so called ‚Äúhotspots‚Äù) that are sensitive to the shape and size of meta-atoms. Nevertheless, a full characterization of the polarization state of the nonlinear optical radiation from the hotspots has not been performed until now. Here we present the results of the polarization-resolved second harmonic generation microscopy studies of planar chiral G-shaped metamaterials. We demonstrate that the SHG radiation coming from the hotspots that are localized within a single meta-atom is partially polarized; moreover, the SHG polarization state reveals the chirality of the structure. The observed effects are attributed to the induced plasmonic current oscillations at the fundamental frequency along with the local field distribution},

	abstract = {The Borrmann effect is the fundamental effect in X-ray physics. It is a strong increase of the transmission of a perfect crystal when the X-rays satisfy the Bragg diffraction condition, originating from X-rays localization between the atomic planes in that case. In other words, the Borrmann effect manifests itself by smaller field losses as the Bragg diffraction law is attained. Following the trend of the transfer of the X-ray phenomena into the optical spectral range, in this work we experimentally observed and studied the optical analog of the Borrmann effect for the case of one-dimensional photonic crystals (PhCs). The studies are performed in the Laue diffraction scheme when no photonic band gaps appear and the light does not experience diffraction-induced light attenuation. We studied the samples of PhCs based on porous fused silica. Samples‚Äô manufacturing consists of two stages. First, porous silicon PhCs are fabricated by electrochemical etching of p-doped Si (100) wafer. The PhCs consist of alternating layers of two types, of high and low porosity, characterized by different refractive indexes. The second stage consists in annealing of the crystals in a muffle at 750o C. Depending on the oxidation time, we obtained the PhCs that are partially or fully annealed. The PhCs produced by both techniques have periodical modulation of refractive indexes and losses. Optical losses in the two types of PhCs are different; in partially annealed PhCs (PhC-I) high refractive index layers absorb light due to the presence of residual silicon, while in fully annealed structures (PhC-II) the losses are determined by light scattering in layers with high porosity (low refractive index layers). PhCs have several hundreds of layers that allow study the effect in the Laue scheme of diffraction. Optical experimental setup is based on a CW laser operating at the wavelength of 720-890 nm, its linearly polarized beam is focused by a lens on the PhC input edge of the into a spot of 130 nm. The silicon photodiode with a large detection region is placed close to the PhC output edge, so the total transmission is measured, including the beams of all diffraction maxima. We studied the transmission of the two types of PhCs as a function of the angle of incidence of the radiation. We observe that the transmission of the PhC-I samples demonstrates sharp peaks, corresponding to the Bragg angles of diffraction. The appearance of these peaks manifests of the Borrmann effect due to the predominant localization of the optical field in the PhC layers with low absorption. At the same time, the PhC-II structures demonstrate nearly monotonic decreasing of transmission as a function of the angle of incidence. So the effect is different for the structures with light losses in high or low refractive index layers. Spectral dependence of the effect shows a number of peculiarities: alternating appearance and disappearance of total transmission maxima and a strong angular narrowing of maxima for definite wavelengths. Interrelation of the observed effects with degeneracies of the PhC band structure is confirmed by theoretical calculations.},

	abstract = {Linear and nonlinear optical properties of a thin planar CoFe‚àïAl2O3‚àïCoFe structure for different angles of incidence of the fundamental radiation are studied by means of the magneto-optical Kerr effect and magnetizationinduced second-harmonic generation (SHG). The composition of this multilayered structure supports the appearance of the antiferromagnetic state, which leads to nonreciprocal optical effects and is discussed in terms of the magnetic toroid moment. We show that in accordance with the phenomenological description, SHG magnetic hysteresis loops for a linearly polarized pump beam are determined by linear in magnetization M components of the SHG polarization, while for a circularly polarized pump such a description necessarily involves both linear and quadratic in M components of the nonlinear polarization. Symmetry analysis of the magnetization-induced SHG supports the differences between the cases of linear and circular polarization of the incident radiation observed in the experiment, as well as a partial suppression of first in magnetization SHG contributions. Relative values of the linear and quadratic in magnetization components of the SHG polarization are estimated for the trilayer structure and for a reference homogeneous ferromagnetic film},

	abstract = {Optical metasurfaces are thin-layer subwavelengthpatterned structures that interact strongly with light. Metasurfaces have become the subject of several rapidly growing areas of research, being a logical extension of the field of metamaterials towards their practical applications. Metasurfaces demonstrate many useful properties of metadevices with engineered resonant electric and magnetic optical responses combined with low losses of thin-layer structures. Here we introduce the basic concepts of this rapidly growing research field that stem from earlier studies of frequencyselective surfaces in radiophysics, being enriched by the recent development of metamaterials and subwavelength nanophotonics. We review the most interesting properties of photonic metasurfaces, demonstrating their useful functionalities such as frequency selectivity, wavefront shaping, polarization control, etc. We discuss the ways to achieve tunability of metasurfaces and also demonstrate that nonlinear effects can be enhanced with the help of metasurface engineering.},

The diffraction-thick PhC contained 360 spatial periods with a large variation of the refractive index of adjacent layers of 0.4. The experiments reveal switching of the light leaving the PhC between the two spatial directions, which correspond to Laue diffraction maxima, as the fundamental wavelength or polarization of the incident light is varied. A similar effect can be achieved when the temperature of the sample or the intensity of the additional laser beam illuminating the crystal are changed. We show that in our PhC structures, the spectral period of the pendulum effect is down to 5‚Äânm, while the thermal period is about 10‚Äâ¬∞C.},

At the Laue geometry of diffraction the incident wave splits into four waves that correspond to the two eigenmodes of the electromagnetic field inside a multilayer 1D PC, the so called Borrmann and anti-Borrmann optical modes. The first one is localized mostly inside the layers with smaller value of the refractive index, while the latter one ‚Äì in those with larger refractive index. It was shown theoretically [3] that different combinations of these four waves can be used for effective phase-matching second harmonic generation (SHG) in periodic structures.},

We show that at normal incidence, the intensity of the second-harmonic (SH) wave generated by the array of nanostructures increases by an order of magnitude as the excitation wavelength approaches the magnetic-dipole resonance, while the phase of the SH wave experiences a shift up to 330{\textbackslash}circ. Based on the phenomenological description of the SH process, the observed effects indicate the dominant role of the nonlinear magnetic-dipole polarization driven by the ÃÇemm susceptibility in SH generation in ‚Äúnanosandwiches.‚Äù},

Contrary to the kinematic Bragg diffraction, the dynamical one considers a continuous interaction between the waves travelling within a spatially-periodic structure and is the most pronounced in the so called Laue geometry, leading to a number of exciting phenomena. In the described experiments, we study the PhC based on porous silicon or porous quartz, made by the electrochemical etching of crystalline silicon with the consequent thermal annealing. Importantly, these PhC are approximately hundreds of microns thick and contain a few hundreds of periods, so that the experiments in the Laue diffraction scheme are available. We discuss the effect of the temporal splitting of femtosecond laser pulses and show that the effect is quite sensitive to the polarization and the phase of a femtosecond laser pulse. We also show the experimental realization of the Pendular effect in porous quartz PhC and demonstrate the experimental conditions for the total spatial switching of the output radiation between the transmitted and diffracted directions. All described effects are of high interest for the control over the light propagation based on PhC structures.},

It is demonstrated that the characteristic length of the laser pulse path in a PC, or splitting length, used to describe the temporal pulse splitting, as well as the number of the outgoing femtosecond pulses, are influenced significantly by the polarization of the incident laser pulse. We have observed that the characteristic splitting time in porous quartz PCs for the s-polarized probe pulse polarization is approximately 1.5 times smaller as compared with that measured for the p-polarized radiation. These results are supported by the theoretical description and ensure that the polarization sensitivity of the DIPS effect is due to a large lattice-induced dispersion of the PC. It is also shown that the number of output pulses can be varied from two up to four in both transmission and diffraction directions depending on the polarization of incident femtosecond pulses.},

Qualitatively different SHG magnetic hysteresis loops are obtained for circular and linear polarizations of the fundamental radiation. In the first case, a wide SHG hysteresis at zero DC magnetic field H is observed, which is attributed to a macroscopic magnetic toroid moment in Co nanodots induced by a noncentrosymmetric distribution of the magnetization. On the contrary, for the linear pump polarization the SHG loop is similar to observed commonly in linear magnetooptics for vortex magnetic structures and reveals a rather narrow width at H=0. A phenomenological SHG description based on the introduction of the SHG polarization induced by a magnetic toroid moment in vortex magnetic nanostructures is presented.},

	abstract = {We report on the investigations of spin wave modes in arrays of densely packed Co nanorods using Brillouin light scattering. We have observed a significant role of spin wave modes along the nanorod axis in contrast to infinite magnetic nanowires. Unusual optical properties featuring an inverted Stokes/anti-Stokes asymmetry of the Brillouin scattering spectra have been observed. The spectrum of spin wave modes in the nanorod array has been calculated and compared with the experiment. Experimental observations are explained in terms of a combined numerical-analytical approach taking into account both the low aspect ratio of individual magnetic nanorods and dipolar magnetic coupling between the nanorods in the array. The optical studies of spin-wave modes in the metamaterials with low aspect ratio nanorods have revealed new magnetic and magneto-optical properties compared to continuous magnetic films or infinite magnetic nanowires. Such magnetic metamaterials are important class of active metamaterials needed for prospective data storage and signal processing applications. (c) 2012 Optical Society of America},

	abstract = {Second harmonic generation by a disordered array of superparamagnetic nanoparticles in a static magnetic field H is studied experimentally. For H = 0, only hyper-Rayleigh scattering takes place; i.e., the second-harmonic radiation is diffuse and unpolarized. For H not equal 0, a coherent (specular and linearly polarized) component appears against the hyper-Rayleigh scattering background. The phase of the coherent component changes by pi when the direction of the magnetic field is reversed. It is shown that the effect can be explained by correlations in the spatial fluctuations of the nonlinear-optical and magnetic polarizabilities of the particles, taking into account the nonuniformity of the effective (local) static magnetic field.},

The experiments are carried out for one-dimensional porous silicon-based PC consisting of 375 spatial periods of 800 nm thick and using a femtosecond Ti-sapphire laser as a probe. A linear dependence of the time splitting of each pair of transmitted and diffractively reflected pulses on the crystal thickness is demonstrated and is supported by theoretical estimations.},

Graphene layers are manufactured by the chemical vapor deposition technique and deposited on an oxidized Si(001) substrate. SHG intensity from the graphene layer is found to be negligible in the absence of the dc current, while it increases dramatically with the application of the electric current. The current-induced change of the SHG intensity from graphene/SiO2/Si(001) rises linearly with the current amplitude and changes its sign under the reversal of the current direction to the opposite. The observed effect is explained in terms of the interference of second harmonic radiation reflected from the Si surface and that induced by the dc current in multilayer graphene.},

	abstract = {Photonic crystals (PC) are periodic structures with a period of about the wavelength of a visible light. The simplest PC is an array periodically alternating dielectric layers of two types. At the Laue geometry (when the light propagates through the PC along the layers) the effects of the dynamical diffraction theory were observed, e.g. pendell√∂sung effect and Borrmann effect. It was theoretically predicted that the femtosecond laser pulse at Laue geometry in 1d PC undergoes two consequent splitting: spatial and temporal. The spatial splitting is caused by the dynamical diffraction on the PC lattice and the temporal splitting can be explained as the formation of two spatial modes called borrmann and antiborrmann in a crystal and each of these modes is localized in layers of its own type. Therefore these modes have different group velocities depending on the refraction indices of two layers and these modes will split in time.},

It was experimentally observed for the X-ray, neutron and microwave diffraction. In 2006 it was observed in optical range for the diffraction of light in 3-dimetsional opal photonic crystals. This effect can be used to obtain negative-index materials, for optical switching, Recently the pendell√∂sung effect in one-dimensional photonic crystal at Laue geometry was predicted. The considered crystal consists of periodically alternating dielectric layers of two types. The pendell√∂sung effect is caused by the formation of two spatial modes called borrmann and antiborrmann in a crystal and each of these modes is localized in layers of its own type. The periodic exchange of energy between these modes occurs. We present the numerical simulation and the experimental observation of this effect in the porous silicon photonic crystal.},

Infiltration of sodium nitrite into the pores essentially suppresses HRS and results in generation of specular and partially polarized SH. Dissimilarly, the third-harmonic (TH) radiation from both unfilled and infiltrated samples is specular and polarized. These results indicate different spatial localization of the SH and TH sources.

High thermal stability of Bi(C6H5)(3) makes the film stoichiometry very sensible to the deposition conditions, in particular to the precursor residence time in the reactor. We tested novel precursors Bi(thd)(3) and Bi(CH3COO)(3) possessing lower thermal stability. They drive the process into the diffusion control regime when cation stoichiometry in the layer is easier to control. The possibility to use them for epitaxial growth of BiFeO3 thin films was demonstrated. BiFeO3 film forms the self-organized nanodomain variant structure with (110) out-of-plane orientation on (001) ZrO2(Y2O3) substrate. The high resolution TEM images confirm variant domain structure formation. The ferroelectric nature of BiFCO3 films was assessed at the room temperature by piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM).

X-ray diffraction analysis shows cube-on-cube epitaxial growth of BiFeO3 on (001) SrTiO3. The strongly reduced bismuth transfer into the film due to the high thermal stability of Bi(C6H5)(3) was counterbalanced by the increase of the total pressure as well as of the residence time of the precursor flow in the reactor; the Bi/Fe ratio in the film thus becomes close to that in the precursor mixture. Optical second harmonic generation measurements have evidenced the ferroelectric ordering in BiFeO3 films and the apparent decrease of the Curie temperature of the strained films as compared to BiFeO3 single crystal.

The ferroelectric switching is detected in biased FLC cells by measuring azimuthal dependences of linear and nonlinear responses. The applied dc electric field rotates the FLC symmetry axis with initial and final orientations in the cell plane. Comparative studies of the SHG switching behavior in reflection and transmission geometries allows one to distinguish the contributions from the bulk and the subsurface layers of the cell.

Localization of the resonant fundamental radiation in the garnet spacer enhances the absolute values of both nonmagnetic (crystallographic) and magnetization-induced components of second-harmonic, generation manifold. Specific symmetry properties of magnetization-induced second-harmonic generation (MSHG) allow the observation of magnetization-induced variations in the intensity and relative phase of the second-harmonic (SH) wave in transversal configuration. Magnetization-induced variations in the SH intensity with a contrast up to 0.7 and relative SH phase shifts up to 180degrees are observed upon changing, the dc magnetic field direction. They are odd in magnetization due to the interference between magnetization-induced an nonmagnetic components of the SH field that manifest the internal homodyne effect in MSHG. The longitudinal nonlinear-optical magnetic Kerr effect reveals itself in rotation of the polarization plane of the reflected H wave, which reaches values up to 250degrees/mum. The polarization rotation of the SH wave in the polar configuration is found to be approximately 20degrees/mum for fundamental radiation with a wavelength of 860 nm.},

At the same time, SHG interferometry measurements show that definite changes in the FLC structure happen above the bulk transition temperature from SmC* to SmA* phase.

The estimated correlation length of spatial fluctuations of the nonlinear-optical polarization in the film is ‚àº400 nm. These properties are associated with an islandlike structure formed by Gd ions inside LB structural units. ¬© 2000 Optical Society of America.},

SHG intensity measurements on a single crystal HT sample reveal a transition temperature T-c = 313 +/- 2 K and a thermal dependence similar to that of the calculated spontaneous polarization; the frequency conversion efficiency is 26 times that of Y-cut quartz. A comparative study of HT and SC pressed-powder pellets suggests that short-range electric dipole order is associated with limited correlation lengths in the latter. Evidence is also given for a phase transition at 309 K in the SC sample. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},
