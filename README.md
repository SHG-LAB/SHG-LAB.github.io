# [Hugo Research Group Theme](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-research-group)


The **Research Group Template** empowers your research group to easily create a beautiful website with a stunning homepage, news, academic publications, events, team profiles, and a contact form.

Easily write technical content with plain text Markdown, LaTeX math, diagrams, RMarkdown, or Jupyter, and import publications from BibTeX.



The integrated [**Wowchemy**](https://hugoblox.com) website builder and CMS makes it easy to create a beautiful website for free. Edit your site in the CMS (or your favorite editor), generate it with [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo), and deploy with GitHub or Netlify. Customize anything on your site with widgets, light/dark themes, and language packs.
