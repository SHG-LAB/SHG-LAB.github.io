 annote = {The magnetic properties of the surface layer of an epitaxial bismuth-doped iron garnet film with aweak uniaxial anisotropy are studied by magnetic force, optical, and nonlinear optical microscopy. A significant modulation of optical second harmonic generation intensity along stripe domains is detected near the free film surface. This modulation is caused by periodic distortions of the stripe domain structure near the film surface and the presence of surface closure domains detected by magnetic force microscopy (MFM). A series of MFM images of the film taken in an in-plane magnetic field varying from â€“400 to 400 Oe demonstrates quasi-static nucleation of closure domains periodically located along stripe domains.},
