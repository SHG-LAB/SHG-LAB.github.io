 annote = {Epitaxial conducting electrodes (60-300 nm thick) of LaNiO3, La1-xKxMnO3 and ferroelectric KNbO3 thin films were deposited by MOCVD using thd-volatile precursors on SrTiO3 and MgO single crystalline substrates. Influence of epitaxial strain on properties is discussed. Ferroelectric properties of the title heterostructures were characterized by hysteresis measurements, piezo-response force microscopy and second harmonic generation.
