 annote = {Incoherent optical second harmonic (SH) generation, or hyper-Rayleigh scattering (HRS), is used to study the structure and properties of Gd/C18H36O2 multilayer Langmuir-Biodgett (LB) films. SH reflection spectra (in combination with linear absorption spectra), HRS indicatrices, thickness dependence, and wave polarization diagrams are measured for s-polarized fundamental radiation. The SH radiation is entirely diffuse but pre-dominantly s polarized, with the maximum of the HRS indicatrix shifted by 8$∘$ relative to the specular direction, which is interpreted as being due to the contribution of a fluctuating quadrupole to the nonlinear-optical response of the films. The estimated correlation length of spatial fluctuations of the nonlinear-optical polarization in the film is ∼400 nm. These properties are associated with an islandlike structure formed by Gd ions inside LB structural units. © 2000 Optical Society of America.},
