 annote = {Ferroelectric ordering, the electroclinic effect, and chiral smectic C(SmC*)-smectic A phase transitions in thin planar ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) cells are studied by means of linear electro-optic and second harmonic generation (SHG) techniques. The ferroelectric switching is detected in biased FLC cells by measuring azimuthal dependences of linear and nonlinear responses. The applied dc electric field rotates the FLC symmetry axis with initial and final orientations in the cell plane. Comparative studies of the SHG switching behavior in reflection and transmission geometries allows one to distinguish the contributions from the bulk and the subsurface layers of the cell. The analysis of SHG temperature dependences shows the existence of a strong surface coupling. The temperature-dependent nonlinear polarization shows a critical behavior with the exponent similar to0.3 in SmC* phase.},
