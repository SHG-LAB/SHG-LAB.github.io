abstract: We report on the investigations of spin wave modes in arrays of densely
  packed Co nanorods using Brillouin light scattering. We have observed a significant
  role of spin wave modes along the nanorod axis in contrast to infinite magnetic
  nanowires. Unusual optical properties featuring an inverted Stokes/anti-Stokes asymmetry
  of the Brillouin scattering spectra have been observed. The spectrum of spin wave
  modes in the nanorod array has been calculated and compared with the experiment.
  Experimental observations are explained in terms of a combined numerical-analytical
  approach taking into account both the low aspect ratio of individual magnetic nanorods
  and dipolar magnetic coupling between the nanorods in the array. The optical studies
  of spin-wave modes in the metamaterials with low aspect ratio nanorods have revealed
  new magnetic and magneto-optical properties compared to continuous magnetic films
  or infinite magnetic nanowires. Such magnetic metamaterials are important class
  of active metamaterials needed for prospective data storage and signal processing
  applications. (c) 2012 Optical Society of America
