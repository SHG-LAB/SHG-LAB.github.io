abstract: Structural and magnetic properties of superstructure consisting of 2D layers
  of magnetic Gd ions are studied by second harmonic generation (SHG). The incoherent
  SHG (hyper-Rayleigh scattering) as well as magnetization induced effects in SHG
  interferometry and second harmonic (SH) polarization diagrams indicate that GD monolayers
  consist of 2D islands with noncompensated magnetic moment. The periodic structure
  of Gd layers is confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. The SHG studies were performed
  using an output of a nanosecond YAG:Nd3+ laser operating at the wavelength of 1064
  nm.
