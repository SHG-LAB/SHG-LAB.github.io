abstract: Incoherent optical second harmonic generation (SHG) is studied from series
  of multilayer graphene samples of various thickness manufactured by chemical vapor
  deposition technique and deposited over 150 Î¼m thick glass slides. Two different
  values of the correlation lengths are obtained from the linear and SHG indicatrices
  and reveal the existence of two types of optical scatterers. The first one is associated
  with homogeneous graphene areas, while the second one originates from wrinkles at
  the interdomain boundaries. Second harmonic imaging microscopy used to map the distribution
  of the second-order polarization at the nanoscale confirms the results of the nonlinear
  scattering data.
