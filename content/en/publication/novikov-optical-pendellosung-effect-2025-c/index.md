abstract: Intermodal light interference in artificial optical structures has become
  a powerful tool for precise routing of radiation. In periodic systems, it can lead
  to the Pendellösung effect consisting of the energy exchange between diffraction
  orders. Originally discovered for x rays, the optical analog of this phenomenon
  promises to be a viable means for the control of light. In this work, we investigate
  the Pendellösung effect in the visible spectral range in two-dimensional photonic
  crystals (PhCs) with a hexagonal lattice of pores in anodic alumina. We found peculiar
  spectral and angular variations of the light transmission near the Bragg diffraction
  conditions and provide a detailed analysis of the effect.
