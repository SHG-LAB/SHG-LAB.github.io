abstract: Magnetization-induced second-harmonic generation is observed in magnetic
  photonic-crystal microcavities. The microcavity is formed from a half-wavelength-thick
  Bi-substituted yttrium-iron-garnet film sandwiched between two high-finesse dielectric
  Bragg reflectors. The transversal nonlinear magneto-optical Kerr effect reveals
  itself in magnetization-induced variations of the intensity and the relative phase
  of the second-harmonic wave. The variations reach the factor of 4 in intensity and
  180degrees in phase for opposite directions of the dc-magnetic field. The longitudinal
  and polar nonlinear magneto-optical Kerr effects manifest themselves in the considerable,
  up to 50degrees, rotation of the second-harmonic wave polarization.
