abstract: The two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectricity in monolayer Langmuir Blodgett
  (LB) films of copolymer vinylidene fluoride with trifluoroethylene (PVDF/TrFE) is
  studied by optical second-harmonic generation (SHG). The SHG temperature dependences
  are studied in order to reveal the ferroelectric behaviour of the films. For the
  monolayer LB films of PVDF/TrFE, as well as for the multiplayer LB films, a wide
  hysteresis in the SHG intensity under heating and consequent cooling is observed.
  This hysteresis is attributed to the first-order ferroelectric-paraelectric phase
  transition in the extreme case of literally 2D ferroelectric films. It is demonstrated
  that the main contribution to the nonlinear response of the LB films of PVDF/TrFE
  originates from fluctuations of the nonlinear polarization in inhomogeneous film
  structure. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
