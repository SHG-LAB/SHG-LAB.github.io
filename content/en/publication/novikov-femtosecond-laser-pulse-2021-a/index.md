abstract: The ability to manipulate the frequency of light is a cornerstone of a wide
  range of applications in photonics expanding spectral ranges of the light sources.
  To boost the second harmonic generation efficiency, intense efforts toward exploiting
  artificial microstructures for frequency doubling were carried out. The sought-after
  approach of utilizing photonic crystals is inspired by their unusual light dispersion.
  In such structures, the dynamics of the field of femtosecond laser pulses is of
  paramount importance for frequency conversion. In this work, we investigate the
  phase-matched second harmonic generation under the effect of diffraction-induced
  femtosecond laser pulse splitting in one-dimensional photonic crystals at the Bragg
  diffraction in the Laue geometry. We demonstrate that the interaction of the two
  pulses at the fundamental frequency that appears in photonic crystals through the
  dynamical light diffraction leads to a nonmonotonic dependence of the frequency
  up-conversion efficiency with respect to the laser pulse duration, thus allowing
  to increase the second harmonic power by tuning the pulse duration.
