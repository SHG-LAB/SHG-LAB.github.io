 abstract = {Nonlinear magneto-optical and structural properties of organo-metallic Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films containing Gd monolayers are studied by second harmonic generation (SHG). The X-ray diffraction data show that the Gd-LB films consist of periodic layered structures with the Gd monolayers spaced at about 5 nm. The diffuseness and depolarization of the SHG radiation indicate an in-plane island-like inhomogeneity of 2D Gd-layers. Giant nonlinear magneto-optical Kerr effect (NOMOKE) is observed for these films and is interpreted in terms of the interference between the dipole quadratic nonmagnetic contribution to the SH field from electronic system of 2D Gd islands, and magnetization induced contribution from their spin system.},
