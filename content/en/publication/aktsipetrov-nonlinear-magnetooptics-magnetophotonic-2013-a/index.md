abstract: The chapter surveys the results on the investigation of the nonlinear magneto-optical
  properties of magnetophotonic crystals (MPC) and microcavities. The effects of the
  second- and third-harmonics generation as well as nonlinear magneto-optical Faraday
  and Kerr effects are reviewed. The main magnetic ma- terial used in the MPC structures,
  which determines the magneto-optical activity of the magnetophotonic structures,
  is yttriumâ€“iron garnet (YIG), which appears as a continuous layer in 1D MPC, microcavity
  layer in magnetophotonic microcavities or YIG nanoparticles incorporated in artificial
  opal structure. We demonstrate that many-fold amplification of the nonlinear magneto-optical
  effects is attained within the spectral edge of the photonic band gap and within
  the microcavity mode as compared to linear magneto-optical analogs. Strong light
  localization as well as the realization of the phase matching conditions are discussed
  as possible mechanisms of the observed enhancement of the nonlinear magneto-optical
  effects.
