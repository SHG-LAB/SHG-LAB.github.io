abstract: The structure of magnetic domains is an exciting research object that shows
  an enormous variety of delightful patterns. Epitaxial garnet is one of the most
  studied magnetic dielectrics with well-recognized bulk domains, while the magnetic
  composition at the surface is less investigated. Here we apply the nonlinear optical
  microscopy technique for the visualization of the interface magnetic domains of
  10 Î¼m thick (LuBi)3Fe5O12 film and prove that it is qualitatively similar for both
  garnet/air and garnet/substrate interfaces. As an efficient extension of the second
  harmonic generation microscopy, we suggest and demonstrate the possibilities of
  the third harmonic generation one, which provides higher resolution of the method.
