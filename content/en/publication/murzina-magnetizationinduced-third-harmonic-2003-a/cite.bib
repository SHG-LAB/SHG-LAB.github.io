 abstract = {Magnetization-induced third harmonic generation was experimentally observed in thin films of bismuth-doped yttrium-iron garnet. The magnitude of magnetization-induced nonlinear optical response was enhanced through building-in a garnet film into a photonic-crystal microcavity. It was shown that the observed magnetization-induced variations in the third-harmonic intensity were caused by the internal homodyne of interfering weak magnetic and strong nonmagnetic polarization components of the cubic nonlinearity of the garnet.
