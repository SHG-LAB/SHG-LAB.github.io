abstract: We report spatial localization of the effective magnetic field generated
  via the inverse Faraday effect employing surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) at Au/garnet
  interface. Analyzing both numerically and analytically the electric field of the
  SPPs at this interface, we corroborate our study with a proof-of-concept experiment
  showing efficient SPP-driven excitation of coherent spin precession with 0.41 THz
  frequency. We argue that the subdiffractional confinement of the SPP electric field
  enables strong spatial localization of the SPP-mediated excitation of spin dynamics.
  We demonstrate two orders of magnitude enhancement of the excitation efficiency
  at the surface plasmon resonance within a 100 nm layer of a dielectric garnet. Our
  findings broaden the horizons of ultrafast spin-plasmonics and open pathways toward
  nonthermal opto-magnetic recording on the nanoscale.
