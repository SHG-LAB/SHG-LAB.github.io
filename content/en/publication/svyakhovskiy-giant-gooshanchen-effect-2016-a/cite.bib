 abstract = {We present the theoretical and experimental studies of the giant Goos-Hanchen effect and the effect of focusing of light beam in one-dimensional photonic crystals with spatial modulation of photonic band gap position. We show that the photonic crystal with slow exponentially modulated band gap applies the second-order phase modulation to the reflected light and can focus or defocus the light beam.},
