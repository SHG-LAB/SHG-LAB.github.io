abstract: We report some results of studying optical second harmonic generation (SHG)
  on surfaces and at interfaces of centrosymmetric media, in resonant nano- and microstructures,
  and in ferroelectric materials. The research was carried out at the Department of
  Quantum Electronics of the Lomonosov Moscow State University under the supervision
  of Professor O.A. Aktsipetrov, and subsequently developed by his disciples. As examples
  that clearly demonstrate the possibilities of the SHG method for examining nonstandard
  objects of nonlinear optics, we discuss the behaviour of the nonlinear optical response
  of single-crystal silicon and germanium surfaces and their interfaces with oxides,
  as well as nonlinear electroreflection. Optical interferometry and its possibilities
  are briefly described using the example of these systems. Unique sensitivity of
  SHG to the symmetry and resonance properties of nanostructures, including magnetic
  ones, is shown, which determines the efficiency of this method for investigating
  such systems. Finally, we demonstrate that the SHG effect is a unique remote and
  sensitive method for studying ferroelectric structures.
