abstract: Phase transitions in thin (1.5-3 mum) planar cells of a ferroelectric liquid
  crystal (FLC) mixture are studied using the optical second harmonic generation (SHG)
  technique. This method is well known because of its high sensitivity to the structural
  and electronic properties of surfaces, interfaces and thin films, as well as to
  the appearance of the ferroelectric state of a material. It is shown that the studied
  FLC mixture retains a highly regular structure up to about 80 degreesC, when a sharp
  decrease of SHG intensity, associated with the transition of the LC to the nonpolar
  (N*) phase, is observed. SHG intensity measurements show that the transition from
  chiral smectic C (SmC*) to chiral smectic A (SmA*) phase which takes place at about
  45 degreesC for the bulk FLC mixture does not influence the ferroelectric state
  of subsurface FLC layers. At the same time, SHG interferometry measurements show
  that definite changes in the FLC structure happen above the bulk transition temperature
  from SmC* to SmA* phase. A DC electric field induced switching of the FLC cells
  is also observed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
