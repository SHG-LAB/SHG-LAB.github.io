abstract: The results of synthesis and experimental study of two types of nanocomposites
  based on Au/Ni nanorods in porous anodic alumina matrix are presented. The existence
  of two features in the optical spectra of such structures corresponding epsilon-near-zero
  and epsilon-near-pole points is shown. A significant modulation and enhancement
  of the alternating magneto-optical effects are observed in the spectral vicinity
  of these points
