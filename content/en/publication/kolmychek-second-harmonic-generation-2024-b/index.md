abstract: The interaction of laser radiation with magnetic media is a rapidly developing
  field of research,offering broad possibilities both for observing new effects and
  for studying and characterizing magnetic materials at micro- and macrolevels. This
  is especially important in connection with the development of modern technologies,
  which allow the creation of structures with fundamentally new magnetic and optical
  properties, whose realization is impossible in natural materials. The review presents
  the results of research on nonlinear optical effects in ferromagnetic nano- and
  microstructures, as well as films of different compositions. The unique possibilities
  of nonlinear optical diagnostics of anisotropic, vortex, and exchange-biased magnetic
  structures, visualization of the micromagnetic structure of surface layers of ironâ€“garnets
  are demonstrated. The exceptional effectiveness of these approaches is based both
  on the high sensitivity of the method of optical second harmonic generations to
  the magnetic state of nanostructures and interfaces, and on the properties of symmetry
  of tensors of high-order magnetizationinduced susceptibility.
