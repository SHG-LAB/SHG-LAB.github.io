abstract: Hyperbolic metamaterials (HMM) based on multilayered metal/dielectric films
  or ordered arrays of metal nanorods in a dielectric matrix are extremely attractive
  optical materials for manipulating over the parameters of the light flow. One of
  the most promising tools for tuning the optical properties of metamaterials in situ
  is the application of an external magnetic field. However, for the case of HMM based
  on the ordered arrays of magneto-plasmonic nanostructures, this effect has not been
  clearly demonstrated until now. In this paper, we present the results of synthesis
  of HMM based on the highly-ordered arrays of bisegmented Au/Ni nanorods in porous
  anodic alumina templates and a detailed study of their optical and magneto-optical
  properties. Distinct enhancement of the magneto-optical (MO) effects along with
  their sign reversal is observed in the spectral vicinity of epsilon-near-zero and
  epsilon-near-pole spectral regions. The underlying mechanism is the amplification
  of the MO polarization plane rotation initiated by Ni segments followed by the light
  propagation in a strongly birefringent HMM. This stays in agreement with the phenomenological
  description and relevant numerical calculations.
