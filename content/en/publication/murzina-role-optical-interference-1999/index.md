abstract: The role of optical interference in magnetization-induced effects in second-harmonic
  generation (SHG) is studied for magnetic nanostructures. The degree of magnetization-induced
  effects is governed by the fine-structure parameter and is subsequently small in
  low-order susceptibilities, yet enhanced at higher orders. One of the mechanisms
  of the enhancement of magnetization-induced contributions to the SHG intensity is
  related to the optical interference in the far-field region of the second-harmonic
  fields generated by nonmagnetic and magnetization-induced nonlinear polarizations.
  The model of interference is considered for resonant and off-resonant conditions
  in non-centro-symmetric media. This model is used for interpretation of experimental
  results of magnetization-induced SHG studies of Co nanocrystals and Gd monolayers.
