abstract: We reveal theoretically the effects of fast and slow light in transmission
  of femtosecond laser pulses through a silver nanorod-based hyperbolic metamaterial
  (HMM) and demonstrate the decisive role of optical nonlocality of HMMs in the appearance
  of these phenomena in the spectral vicinity of the epsilon-near-zero regime of HMM.
  Results sustain our recent experimental investigations of these effects.
