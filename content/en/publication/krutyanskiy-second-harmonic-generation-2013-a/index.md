abstract: Nonlinear optical properties of a regular array of triangular-shaped vortex
  magnetic nanoparticles is studied using the optical second harmonic generation (SHG)
  technique. We demonstrate that the SHG azimuthal anisotropy is consistent with the
  3m symmetry of individual Co nanodots placed in a square surface lattice. Qualitatively
  different SHG magnetic hysteresis loops are obtained for circular and linear polarizations
  of the fundamental radiation. In the first case, a wide SHG hysteresis at zero DC
  magnetic field H is observed, which is attributed to a macroscopic magnetic toroid
  moment in Co nanodots induced by a noncentrosymmetric distribution of the magnetization.
  On the contrary, for the linear pump polarization the SHG loop is similar to observed
  commonly in linear magnetooptics for vortex magnetic structures and reveals a rather
  narrow width at H=0. A phenomenological SHG description based on the introduction
  of the SHG polarization induced by a magnetic toroid moment in vortex magnetic nanostructures
  is presented.
