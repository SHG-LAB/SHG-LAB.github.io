abstract: Micro- and nanostructuring of optical media is the cornerstone for a wide
  range of applications in optics. Artificial structures significantly enrich the
  interaction of light with dielectrics and metals and are harnessed to reveal exciting
  optical effects. Recently hypercrystals were proposed as intriguing class of periodic
  structures bringing together hyperbolic dispersion law of hyperbolic metamaterials
  and the Bragg diffraction. In this work we proposed the finite-difference frequency-domain
  method for modeling of light diffraction in these highly anisotropic structures.
  The method is suitable for one- and two-dimensional gratings as well as multilayer
  gratings made of anisotropic materials. Developed approach gives advantages over
  the finite-difference time-domain method (FDTD) and rigorous-coupled mode analysis
  (RCWA) widely used for calculation of light diffraction in gratings. Proposed method
  eliminates evaluation of time dynamics and discretization of whole volume of a structure
  as the FDTD does. Instead, Yeeâ€™s mesh of the cross section of the unit cell of grating
  is involved. As well information about the Bloch modes of the field inside the structure
  inaccessible directly for the FDTD is obtained. We used of values of electromagnetic
  field in mesh nodes instead Fourier series applied in the RCWA to overcome difficulties
  of the RCWA for high contrast and highly anisotropic structures as hypercrystals.
  Using the proposed numerical approach, we demonstrate that interface of one-dimensional
  hypercrystals formed by ridges of hyperbolic metamaterial can support excitation
  of the Dyakonov plasmons, which merge the Dyakonov waves supported by the interface
  of birefringent crystal and surface plasmon polaritons in metals.
