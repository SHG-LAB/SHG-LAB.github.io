abstract: Flourish of optics of hyperbolic metamaterials (HMMs) is stimulated by their
  exotic optical properties. Here, we demonstrate resonant changes of the group retardation
  and superluminal-like propagation of femtosecond laser pulses in nanorod-based HMMs
  in the vicinity of epsilon-near-zero spectral point responsible for the transition
  between topologically distinct elliptic and hyperbolic light dispersions. Resonant
  dynamics of ultrashort pulses appears in a unique case when their spectral components
  are in both dispersion regimes simultaneously. Our findings suggest HMMs as a powerful
  platform for future ultrafast photonics and are pivotal for growing nonlinear optics
  of hyperbolic media.
