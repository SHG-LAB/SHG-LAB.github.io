abstract: Organic microstructures attract much attention due to their unique properties
  originating from the design of their shape and optical parameters. In this work
  we discuss the linear, second- and third-order nonlinear optical effects in arrays
  and in individual organic microstructures composed by self-assembling technique
  and formed randomly on top of a solid substrate. The structures under study consist
  of micro-spheres, -hemispheres or -frustums made of red laser dye and reveal an
  intense fluorescence (FL) in the visible spectral range. Importantly, that due to
  a high value of the refractive index and confined geometry, such micro-structures
  support the excitation of whispering gallery modes (WGM), which brings about strong
  and spectrally-selected light localization. We show that an amplification of the
  nonlinear optical effects is observed for these structures as compared to a homogeneous
  dye film of similar composition. The obtained data are in agreement with the results
  of the FDTD calculations performed for the structures of different dimensions. Perspectives
  of application of such type of organic nonlinear microresonators in optical devices
  are discussed.
