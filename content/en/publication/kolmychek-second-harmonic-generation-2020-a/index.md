abstract: Specific features of optical second harmonic (SH) generation in arrays of
  chiral helical nanoholesin a silver film are studied experimentally. An increase
  in the intensity of the second-order nonlinear optical response is observed in the
  region of anomalous resonant transmission. The significant role of the rotational
  symmetry of the array of nanoholes in the formation of the SH response is revealed,
  which determines the azimuthal dependence of both the intensity of the second-order
  optical signal and the SH circular dichroism.
