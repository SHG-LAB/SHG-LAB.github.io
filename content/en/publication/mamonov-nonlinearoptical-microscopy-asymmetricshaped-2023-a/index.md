abstract: Arrays of metal nanostructures have attracted much interest due to their
  unique potential as optical nanoantennas and nanosensors. Here we use the second
  harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy technique for the studies of the nonlinear
  optical (NLO) response of cobalt nanoparticles of triangular and trapezoid shapes
  separated from a Py/Si3N4 film by a 1.5 nm thick MgO spacer. We demonstrate that
  the nonsymmetric elongated shape of planar nanoparticles along with the strong light
  localization effects result in the enhancement of the NLO response, including SHG
  and two-photon fluorescence. We also demonstrate that the efficiency of the SHG
  in nanoparticles is rather sensitive to the polarization of the incident laser beam,
  the visibility of the nanostructures in the nonlinear microscopy images being the
  highest for the linear polarization of the laser beam.
