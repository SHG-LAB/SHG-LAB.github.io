abstract: Chiro-optical signals from chiral molecules/structures are inherently weak.
  In particular, enhancing the circular-dichroism (CD) effect (different absorption
  of left or right circularly polarized light) in the non-linear optical (NLO) signal
  from chiral molecular materials is challenging and imperative since it is advantageous
  in various areas, from biomedical sciences to miniaturized photonic devices. Here
  we suggest and realize for the first time an approach to enhance the CD effect taking
  advantage of the NLO effects resonantly enhanced in the nonlinear chiral organic
  micro-resonators. These R- and S-type resonators in the form of micro-spheres are
  prepared by the self-assembly technique from the corresponding axially chiral enantiomeric
  molecules, namely R- and S-4-[2,2′-diethoxy-6′-(4-formylphenyl)-[1,1′-binaphthalen]-6-yl]benzaldehyde
  in CHCl3/MeOH mixtures. Each enantiomeric micro-sphere, upon optical pumping, acts
  as a whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonator as the photo-luminescence (PL) is excited
  in a single- or in a two-photon regime. We show that the NLO-CD effect and the two-photon
  absorption (TPA) in the case of micro-spheres are at least twice as high as compared
  to a continuous film of the same effective thickness. This is due to pronounced
  field localization effects in micro-spheres with high Q-factor, which increases
  the photon residence time (τP) in a chiral medium and thus strengthens the light–matter
  interaction. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) numerical calculations confirm
  a strong light localization near the boundary of the micro-spheres.
