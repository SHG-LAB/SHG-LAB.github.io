 abstract = {We have envisioned the preparation of an organic NLO surface, i.e., a ﬁlm of frustum-shaped optical resonators self-assembled from an orange-red emitting, NLO molecule to concurrently generate enhanced TPL and/or SHG lasing emis-sions. In brief we present: (i) synthesis of a new red emitting A (dicyano)–D (amino) type non-centrosymmetric molecule with a π-bridge (stilbene-like) and its crystal structure (1), (ii) its self-assembly on a glass surface forming a thin ﬁlm of frustum-shaped optical microresonators, (iii) single-particle WGM resonance PL spectra of microresonators and numerical simula-tions depicting the ﬁeld localization inside these resonators due to WGM resonances, and (iv) production of both random lasing TPL and SHG from the organic NLO surface covered with frustum microresonators.},
