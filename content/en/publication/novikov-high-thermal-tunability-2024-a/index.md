abstract: We experimentally and numerically revealed a salient thermal effect in the
  transmission of the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) metamaterial consisting of an array
  of plasmonic nanorods in a dielectric template. The flavor of the structure is freestanding
  nanorod segments surrounded by nematic liquid crystals possessing a strong thermal
  dependence of the anisotropic refractive index. The observed resonant enhancement
  of the thermal sensitivity of the transmission of this ENZ structure results from
  its nonlocal optical response giving rise to the zero-transmission effect, control
  over which is at the heart of our approach.
