 abstract = {Ultrathin electrode-free ferroelectric Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with trifluoroethylene are experimentally studied by means of optical second harmonic generation (SHG) in a temperature range from 140 K to 380 K. The temperature behavior of spontaneous polarization induced SHG reveals distinct features in the vicinity of 355 K and 295 K which can be attributed to ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transitions in the bulk and at the surface of this two-dimensional structures. Lattice-stiffening transition recently observed in PVDF LB films at 160 K does not show remarkable peculiarities of temperature dependence of SHG that indicates nonpolar changes in LB film structure under this transition.},
