abstract: 'Magnetization-induced second-harmonic generation (SHG) in layer-by-layer
  assembled films containing yttrium iron garnet nanoparticles is observed. The SHG
  intensity, including its magnetoinduced component, linearly increases with the number
  of self-assembling layers, which indicates along with diffuseness of the SHG radiation
  that SHG occurs in its incoherent form: hyper-Rayleigh scattering (HRS). The nonlinear
  magneto-optical Kerr effect in HRS has a noticeable magnetic contrast brought about
  by the internal homodyne mechanism. (C) 2001 American Institute of Physics.'
