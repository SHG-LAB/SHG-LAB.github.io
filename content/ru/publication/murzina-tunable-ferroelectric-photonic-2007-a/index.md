abstract: Ferroelectric photonic band-gap (PBG) structures are fabricated by the infiltration
  of sodium nitrite into the nanoporous silicon templates composed by the electrochemical
  etching of n-type silicon. Reversible spectral tuning of the PBG and of the microcavity
  mode up to 15 nm is attained in the temperature interval from 50 to 165 degrees
  C due to the temperature changes of the refractive index of sodium nitrite in nanoporous
  silicon matrix. Optical second-harmonic generation measurements prove the ferroelectric
  state of the composed nanocomposite PBG structures. (c) 2007 American Institute
