abstract: Properties of one-dimensional spatially periodic metal structures formed
  by a dielectric lattice covered by gold and permalloy films are studied by optical
  and magnetooptical spectroscopy techniques. It is shown that these structures reveal
  the excitation of surface plasmon-polaritons, with the resonance frequency that
  can be controlled by the geometry of the experiment. The magnetooptical Kerr effect
  modulation, which is absent in the case of a nonprofiled gold/permalloy bifilm,
  is observed in the spectral vicinity of the plasmon resonance.
