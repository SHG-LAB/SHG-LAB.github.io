 abstract = {Self‐assembled organic and polymer optical whispering‐gallery‐mode resonators (WGMRs) are emerging as a potential alternative to traditional inorganic resonators. In the beginning, this article presents a brief overview of the key parameters of interest in WGMRs and nonlinear optical properties. Later, recent results are surveyed demonstrating exciting properties of self‐assembled organic and polymer WGMRs of various shapes in the amplification of linear and nonlinear optical effects due to a strong light confinement associated with WGM excitation.},
