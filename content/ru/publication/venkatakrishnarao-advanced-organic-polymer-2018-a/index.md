abstract: Self‐assembled organic and polymer optical whispering‐gallery‐mode resonators
  (WGMRs) are emerging as a potential alternative to traditional inorganic resonators.
  In the beginning, this article presents a brief overview of the key parameters of
  interest in WGMRs and nonlinear optical properties. Later, recent results are surveyed
  demonstrating exciting properties of self‐assembled organic and polymer WGMRs of
  various shapes in the amplification of linear and nonlinear optical effects due
  to a strong light confinement associated with WGM excitation.
