abstract: Chiral planar metamaterials are known for their possibility to show strong
  nonlinear optical effects such as second harmonic generation (SHG) circular dichroism
  or asymmetric SHG. The underlying mechanisms are commonly discussed in terms of
  local field effects and formation of localized SHG sources (so called ``hotspots'')
  that are sensitive to the shape and size of meta-atoms. Nevertheless, a full characterization
  of the polarization state of the nonlinear optical radiation from the hotspots has
  not been performed until now. Here we present the results of the polarization-resolved
  second harmonic generation microscopy studies of planar chiral G-shaped metamaterials.
  We demonstrate that the SHG radiation coming from the hotspots that are localized
  within a single meta-atom is partially polarized; moreover, the SHG polarization
  state reveals the chirality of the structure. The observed effects are attributed
  to the induced plasmonic current oscillations at the fundamental frequency along
  with the local field distribution
