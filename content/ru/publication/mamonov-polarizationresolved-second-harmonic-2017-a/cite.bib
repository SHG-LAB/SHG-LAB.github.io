 abstract = {Chiral planar metamaterials are known for their possibility to show strong nonlinear optical effects such as second harmonic generation (SHG) circular dichroism or asymmetric SHG. The underlying mechanisms are commonly discussed in terms of local field effects and formation of localized SHG sources (so called “hotspots”) that are sensitive to the shape and size of meta-atoms. Nevertheless, a full characterization of the polarization state of the nonlinear optical radiation from the hotspots has not been performed until now. Here we present the results of the polarization-resolved second harmonic generation microscopy studies of planar chiral G-shaped metamaterials. We demonstrate that the SHG radiation coming from the hotspots that are localized within a single meta-atom is partially polarized; moreover, the SHG polarization state reveals the chirality of the structure. The observed effects are attributed to the induced plasmonic current oscillations at the fundamental frequency along with the local field distribution},
