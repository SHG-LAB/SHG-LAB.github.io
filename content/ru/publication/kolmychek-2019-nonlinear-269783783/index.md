abstract: We survey the main results of recent studied of the nonlinear optical effects
  in metasurfaces that reveal pronounced plasmonic effects. Optical second harmonic
  generation and two-photon absorption, plasmon-induced spatial localization of the
  optical field. nonlinear magnetooptical effects in magneto-plasmonic scystals are
  discussed. We demonstrate a number of examples demonstrating advantages of the nonlinear-optical
  diagnostics tools for the visualization of tiny properties of nanostructures.
