abstract: The films studied are fabricated by LB vertical lift from the water solution
  of Gd acetate, as the Gd ions are adsorbed on the stearic acid LB monolayer created
  on the water subphase surface. The chemical analysis shows that the structural unit
  of the LB films consists of the patterns reveal almost perfect periodic layered
  structure of LB films studied. For the spectroscopic magnetization induced second
  harmonic generation studies the output of a femtosecond Ti:sapphire laser is used
  with the wavelength tuning range from 700 to 800 nm.
