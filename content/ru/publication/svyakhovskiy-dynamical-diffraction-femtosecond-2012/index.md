abstract: 'Photonic crystals (PC) are periodic structures with a period of about the
  wavelength of a visible light. The simplest PC is an array periodically alternating
  dielectric layers of two types. At the Laue geometry (when the light propagates
  through the PC along the layers) the effects of the dynamical diffraction theory
  were observed, e.g. pendell√∂sung effect and Borrmann effect. It was theoretically
  predicted that the femtosecond laser pulse at Laue geometry in 1d PC undergoes two
  consequent splitting: spatial and temporal. The spatial splitting is caused by the
  dynamical diffraction on the PC lattice and the temporal splitting can be explained
  as the formation of two spatial modes called borrmann and antiborrmann in a crystal
  and each of these modes is localized in layers of its own type. Therefore these
  modes have different group velocities depending on the refraction indices of two
  layers and these modes will split in time.'
