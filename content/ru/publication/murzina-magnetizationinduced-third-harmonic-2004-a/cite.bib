 abstract = {Magnetization-induced third harmonic (TH) generation was observed in magnetic nanostructures-nanogranular CoxAg1 - x films-possessing giant magnetoresistance (GMR). The magnetization-induced contribution to the TH intensity was studied as a function of the concentration of a magnetic component (cobalt) in the films. Magnetic contrast of the TH intensity was found to correlate with the GMR coefficient: both parameters simultaneously reach extremum in the range of cobalt concentrations x similar to 0.3-0.35.
