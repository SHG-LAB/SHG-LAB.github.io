abstract: 'Magnetization-induced third harmonic (TH) generation was observed in magnetic
  nanostructures-nanogranular CoxAg1 - x films-possessing giant magnetoresistance
  (GMR). The magnetization-induced contribution to the TH intensity was studied as
  a function of the concentration of a magnetic component (cobalt) in the films. Magnetic
  contrast of the TH intensity was found to correlate with the GMR coefficient: both
  parameters simultaneously reach extremum in the range of cobalt concentrations x
  similar to 0.3-0.35. (C) 2004 MAIK dqNauka / Interperiodicadq.'
