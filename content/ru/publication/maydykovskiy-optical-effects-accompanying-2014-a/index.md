abstract: We survey our recent results on the observation and studies of the effects
  accompanying the dynamical Bragg diffraction in one-dimensional photonic crystals
  (PhC). Contrary to the kinematic Bragg diffraction, the dynamical one considers
  a continuous interaction between the waves travelling within a spatially-periodic
  structure and is the most pronounced in the so called Laue geometry, leading to
  a number of exciting phenomena. In the described experiments, we study the PhC based
  on porous silicon or porous quartz, made by the electrochemical etching of crystalline
  silicon with the consequent thermal annealing. Importantly, these PhC are approximately
  hundreds of microns thick and contain a few hundreds of periods, so that the experiments
  in the Laue diffraction scheme are available. We discuss the effect of the temporal
  splitting of femtosecond laser pulses and show that the effect is quite sensitive
  to the polarization and the phase of a femtosecond laser pulse. We also show the
  experimental realization of the Pendular effect in porous quartz PhC and demonstrate
  the experimental conditions for the total spatial switching of the output radiation
  between the transmitted and diffracted directions. All described effects are of
  high interest for the control over the light propagation based on PhC structures.
