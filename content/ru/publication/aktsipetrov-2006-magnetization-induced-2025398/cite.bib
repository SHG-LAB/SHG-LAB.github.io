 abstract = {Magnetization-induced optical third-harmonic generation (MTHG) is observed in magnetic nanostructures: Co and Fe nanolayers and granular films containing Co nanoparticles. Magnetization-induced variations of the MTHG characteristics in these nanostructures exceed the typical values of linear magneto-optical Kerr effect by at least an order of magnitude: the maximum of magnetic contrast in the MTHG intensity is up to 0.2, the angle of polarization rotation for MTHG is 10 degrees, and the relative phase shift is up to 100 degrees. Correlation between the concentration dependencies of magnetic contrast in MTHG intensity and coefficient of giant magnetoresistance is observed below the percolation threshold in CoxAg1-x films. This points out the probable relations between mechanisms of these transport and nonlinear magneto-optical phenomena.},
