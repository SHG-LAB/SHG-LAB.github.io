abstract: Strong angular asymmetry of second harmonic generation (SHG) is observed
  in an anisotropic plasmonic crystal. The asymmetry is enhanced up to 95% by the
  surface plasmon polariton (SPP) excitation at the anisotropic interface. The SHG
  output is shown to be sensitive to the SPP propagation direction.
