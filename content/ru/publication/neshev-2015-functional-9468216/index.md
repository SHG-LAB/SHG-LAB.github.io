abstract: Optical metasurfaces are thin-layer subwavelengthpatterned structures that
  interact strongly with light. Metasurfaces have become the subject of several rapidly
  growing areas of research, being a logical extension of the field of metamaterials
  towards their practical applications. Metasurfaces demonstrate many useful properties
  of metadevices with engineered resonant electric and magnetic optical responses
  combined with low losses of thin-layer structures. Here we introduce the basic concepts
  of this rapidly growing research field that stem from earlier studies of frequencyselective
  surfaces in radiophysics, being enriched by the recent development of metamaterials
  and subwavelength nanophotonics. We review the most interesting properties of photonic
  metasurfaces, demonstrating their useful functionalities such as frequency selectivity,
  wavefront shaping, polarization control, etc. We discuss the ways to achieve tunability
  of metasurfaces and also demonstrate that nonlinear effects can be enhanced with
  the help of metasurface engineering.
