 annote = {Optical metasurfaces are thin-layer subwavelengthpatterned
structures that interact strongly with light. Metasurfaces
have become the subject of several rapidly growing
areas of research, being a logical extension of the field
of metamaterials towards their practical applications. Metasurfaces
demonstrate many useful properties of metadevices
with engineered resonant electric and magnetic optical responses
combined with low losses of thin-layer structures.
Here we introduce the basic concepts of this rapidly growing
research field that stem from earlier studies of frequencyselective
surfaces in radiophysics, being enriched by the recent
development of metamaterials and subwavelength nanophotonics.
We review the most interesting properties of photonic
metasurfaces, demonstrating their useful functionalities
such as frequency selectivity, wavefront shaping, polarization
control, etc. We discuss the ways to achieve tunability
of metasurfaces and also demonstrate that nonlinear effects
can be enhanced with the help of metasurface engineering.},
