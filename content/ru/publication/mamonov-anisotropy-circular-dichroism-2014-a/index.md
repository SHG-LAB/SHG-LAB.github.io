abstract: Circular dichroism in optical second harmonic generation (CD-SHG) is studied
  in planar symmetrical arrays of G-shaped and mirror-G-shaped nanostructures. Anisotropic
  CD-SHG measurements demonstrate a strong dependence of the value and the sign of
  theCD effect on the angle of incidence of the fundamental radiation. We show that
  both dipole and higher order multipole components of the second order susceptibility
  are responsible for theCD response from G-shaped nanostructures.
