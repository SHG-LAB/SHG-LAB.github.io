abstract: We implemented a Microbubble Resonator (MBRs) as an opto-thermal transducer
  to reconstruct the absorption spectrum of a nanoparticle suspension through its
  temperature increase. The experimental configuration features the MBR as both the
  vial containing the suspension and the optical transducer, allowing for a sensitive
  ultra-compact system with a straightforward microfluidic integration. With respect
  to a previous publication, the active lock of the MBR resonance produced an order-of-magnitude
  improvement in the system performance and a smooth absorption reconstruction. Additionally,
  since the detection process is temperature-based, the measurement is intrinsically
  insensitive towards scattering spectrum, both of the particles and of the host liquid.
  These features make the MBR system an interesting candidate for the characterisation
  of extremely small samples in the context of medical diagnosis from whole biological
  samples, quality controls for food safety or chemical production processes, and,
  in general, for the measurement of absorption in opaque mediums.
