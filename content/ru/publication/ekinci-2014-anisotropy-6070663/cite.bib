 abstract = {Circular dichroism in optical second harmonic generation (CD-SHG) is studied in planar symmetrical arrays of G-shaped and mirror-G-shaped nanostructures. Anisotropic CD-SHG measurements demonstrate a strong dependence of the value and the sign of theCD effect on the angle of incidence of the fundamental radiation. We show that both dipole and higher order multipole components of the second order susceptibility are responsible for theCD response from G-shaped nanostructures.},
