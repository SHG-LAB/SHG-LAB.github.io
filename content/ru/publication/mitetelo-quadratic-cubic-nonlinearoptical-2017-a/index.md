abstract: Optical and nonlinear-optical properties of microstructures of different
  shapes (hemispheres, frustums and rods) self-assembled from organic dye of high
  nonlinear susceptibilities are studied. We demonstrate an enhancement of cubic self-action
  effects in the microstructures in comparison to these effects in corresponding continuous
  films, which is attributed to the whispering gallery modes excitation. The spectra
  of these modes and the field distribution within the microstructures are simulated
  by means of FDTD methods. The field localization data obtained from calculations
  correspond to the two-photon microscopy images of the structures.
