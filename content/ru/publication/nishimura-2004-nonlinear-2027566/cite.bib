 abstract = {In this article, recently published and new results of nonlinear magnetooptical studies of magnetic photonic band-gap materials-magnetophotonic crystals (MPCs) and microcavities-are surveyed. Nonlinear-optical magnetic Kerr effect in MPC with a half-wavelength-thick Bi-substituted yttriurn-iron-garnet layer sandwiched between two dielectric Bragg, reflectors is studied in transversal, longitudinal, and polar configurations of the dc magnetic field application when the fundamental radiation is in the resonance with the allowed microcavity mode located in the photonic band gap. Localization of the resonant fundamental radiation in the garnet spacer enhances the absolute values of both nonmagnetic (crystallographic) and magnetization-induced components of second-harmonic, generation manifold. Specific symmetry properties of magnetization-induced second-harmonic generation (MSHG) allow the observation of magnetization-induced variations in the intensity and relative phase of the second-harmonic (SH) wave in transversal configuration. Magnetization-induced variations in the SH intensity with a contrast up to 0.7 and relative SH phase shifts up to 180degrees are observed upon changing, the dc magnetic field direction. They are odd in magnetization due to the interference between magnetization-induced an nonmagnetic components of the SH field that manifest the internal homodyne effect in MSHG. The longitudinal nonlinear-optical magnetic Kerr effect reveals itself in rotation of the polarization plane of the reflected H wave, which reaches values up to 250degrees/mum. The polarization rotation of the SH wave in the polar configuration is found to be approximately 20degrees/mum for fundamental radiation with a wavelength of 860 nm.},
