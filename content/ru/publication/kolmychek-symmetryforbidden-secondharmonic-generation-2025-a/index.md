abstract: Interaction of the laser radiation with magnetic nanostructures continuously
  attracts high research interest. This issue concerns the studies of surface-driven
  mechanisms of the magneto-optical response of multicomponent structures composed
  of magnetic and nonmagnetic specimen. Here we study the magnetization-induced optical
  second-harmonic generation in its relation to the magnetization dynamics induced
  in bilayer ferromagnetic/heavy metal nanofilms by the magnetic field of an intense
  femtosecond laser pulse. We show the appearance of odd in magnetization intensity
  effect in the second-harmonic generation (SHG), which correlates with the damping
  of the magnetization oscillations at the optical wave frequency as was predicted
  quite recently. The efficiency of the effect is of a few percent as compared to
  the nonmagnetic SHG and is the most pronounced for the so-called ‚Äúforbidden‚Äù SHG
  geometry, i.e., for the ùëù-polarized incident and reflected waves in the longitudinal
  magnetization scheme. This magnetization-dynamics-induced SHG contribution is shown
  to be anisotropic, sensitive to the angle of incidence of the probe beam, and is
  the largest for the CoPt films due to the maximum Gilbert damping constant.
