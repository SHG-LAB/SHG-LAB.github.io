abstract: Interfaces between ferromagnetic metals and nonmagnetic specimen attract
  much attention as they are very important for the formation of magnetic properties
  of nanostructures. Vice versa, specific magnetic ordering at such interfaces may
  provide new effects in their optical and nonlinear optical response. In this work
  we study the magnetization-induced effects in optical second harmonic generation
  (SHG) in W/Co/Pt-based thin films with the thicknesses of the Co layer of 2-10 nm.
  Besides common odd in magnetization effects in the SHG intensity, we observe additional
  one that is not expected for homogeneously magnetized ferromagnetic films, which
  consists in modulation of p-polarized SHG intensity under longitudinal magnetic
  field application. The phenomenological description of the observed effect is performed
  in terms of gradient and second-order in magnetization contributions to the SHG
  polarization, where gradient of magnetization along the normal to the structure
  plays the key role.
