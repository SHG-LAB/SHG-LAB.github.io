 abstract = {Organic microstructures attract much attention due to their exciting properties that can be introduced by a proper choice of the composition, shape and alignment in an array. Here we apply the nonlinear optical microscopy for the studies of resonant properties of individual response of organic microspheres of various compositions. The observed spectral modulation of the two-photon luminescence spectra of such structures is caused by excitation of the whispering gallery modes (WGMs) that correspond to the two-photon luminescence spectrum of a particular microparticle specimen. Lasing and photobleaching effects induced by intense near-IR laser radiation are discussed.},
