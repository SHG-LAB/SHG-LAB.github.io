abstract: 'Optical second-harmonic generation (SHG) is used as a noninvasive probe
  of two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectricity in Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of the
  copolymer vinylidene fluoride with trifluoroethylene. The surface 2D ferroelectric
  - paraelectric phase transition in the topmost layer of the LB films and a thickness-independent
  (almost 2D) transition in the bulk of these films are observed in temperature studies
  of SHG. (C) 2000 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 190.4350, 190.4710, 190.2620,
