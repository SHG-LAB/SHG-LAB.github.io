 abstract = {Magneto-optical effects in metalâ€“dielectric nanostructured materials based on opal films coated with a thin cobalt/silver nanolayer, whose surface has a close-packed hexagonal lattice of metal nanohemispheres and nanoholes, have been investigated. It has been demonstrated experimentally and theoretically that a wide spectrum of modes of propagating surface plasmon polaritons is excited in such a system, which leads to a resonant enhancement of the magneto-optical effect in the Voigt geometry.},
