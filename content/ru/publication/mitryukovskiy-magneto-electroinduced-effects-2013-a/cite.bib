 abstract = {Optical second-harmonic (SH) generation in planar Au/Co/Si(111) nanostructures under application of static magnetic and electric fields is studied experimentally. The crystallographic, magneto- and electroinduced contributions to the SH intensity reveal strong azimuthal anisotropy peculiar to the Si(111) surface. The transient times characterizing the electroinduced quadratic response are found to exceed 1â€‰s. Relative amplitudes and phases of the magneto- and electroinduced constituents of the SH signal are estimated from the measurements data.},
