abstract: Optical second-harmonic (SH) generation in planar Au/Co/Si(111) nanostructures
  under application of static magnetic and electric fields is studied experimentally.
  The crystallographic, magneto- and electroinduced contributions to the SH intensity
  reveal strong azimuthal anisotropy peculiar to the Si(111) surface. The transient
  times characterizing the electroinduced quadratic response are found to exceed 1â€‰s.
  Relative amplitudes and phases of the magneto- and electroinduced constituents of
  the SH signal are estimated from the measurements data.
