abstract: Organic polar crystals are a promising material platform for achieving unique
  nonlinear nanophotonic properties. Mainly, tunable second-harmonic generation (SHG)
  with continuous-wave (CW) pump sources is considered as breakthrough technology
  for optical switching, actuation, sensing, chip-integrated coherent light sources,
  and low-threshold tunable microlasers. Here, the discovery of tunable CW SHG in
  a polar (non-centrosymmetric) electro-mechanical microcrystal cavity of 4-(4-(methylthio)phenyl)-2,6-di(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine
  (UOH1) is demonstrated. As a result of total internal reflection in mirror-like
  light-reflecting facets and its high second-order nonlinear susceptibility, the
  octahedron-shaped cavities exhibit both bright femtosecond and CW-pumped SHG with
  coherent whispering gallery mode (WGM) and bow-tie-like (BT) optical modes excited
  in its spectrum. Moreover, for an external dc electric field of about 23 kV cmâˆ’1
  the microcavity displays 0.18 nm resonant wavelength peak shift in the second harmonic
  signal due to electrostriction (strain effect).
