 abstract = {The structural and magnetic properties of a cobalt nanolayer placed between a silicon substrate and a protective gold layer are studied. At a cobalt layer mass thickness of 1-2 nm, a nanoisland structure is shown to form. This thickness range is characterized by a local maximum of the magnetooptical Kerr effect and enhanced nonlinear optical and magnetic nonlinear optical responses at the second-harmonic frequency. This enhancement can be caused by the excitation of local surface plasmons and an increase in the local fields at the probing-radiation and second-harmonic frequencies in metallic nanoislands. The surface-sensitive nonlinear magnetooptical Kerr effect at the second-harmonic frequency is maximal at a cobalt layer thickness of about 2 nm, which corresponds to the characteristic scale of magnetization formation in the near-surface layer in cobalt.},
