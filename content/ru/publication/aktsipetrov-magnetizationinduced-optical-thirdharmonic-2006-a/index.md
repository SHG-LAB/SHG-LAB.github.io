abstract: 'Magnetization-induced optical third-harmonic generation (MTHG) is observed
  in magnetic nanostructures: Co and Fe nanolayers and granular films containing Co
  nanoparticles. Magnetization-induced variations of the MTHG characteristics in these
  nanostructures exceed the typical values of linear magneto-optical Kerr effect by
  at least an order of magnitude: the maximum of magnetic contrast in the MTHG intensity
  is up to 0.2, the angle of polarization rotation for MTHG is 10 degrees, and the
  relative phase shift is up to 100 degrees. Correlation between the concentration
  dependencies of magnetic contrast in MTHG intensity and coefficient of giant magnetoresistance
  is observed below the percolation threshold in CoxAg1-x films. This points out the
  probable relations between mechanisms of these transport and nonlinear magneto-optical
  phenomena.'
