 abstract = {Plasmonic crystals is a class of periodically (nano)- structured materials that reveal a number of artificial resonances associated with the surface plasmon-polariton (SPP) excitation. They are characterized by a resonant enhancement of optical and nonlinear optical effects due to electromagnetic local field amplification [1]. A new route of the development of this area appeared as magnetic materials were introduced as a part of plasmonic crystals, thus forming the magneto-plasmonic crystals (MPC). It was recognized that under the SPP excitation, resonant enhancement of the magneto-optical (MO) effects is achieved as well. Taking into consideration that the SPP resonances are artificial, introduced by the periodicity of the plasmonic crystal, this provides a possibility for the control over MO resonances that is rather prospective for applications. Up to not, two most popular MPC structures were studied, that are made of a combination of a noble (plasmonic) metal and a magnetic dielectric, and surface gratings made of ferromagnetic metals [2]. Here we show that an MPC composed of nanoperforated silver layer covered by a thin permalloy film reveals surface plasmon polariton excitation accompanied by an appearance of the tunable resonance of the magneto-optical response.},
