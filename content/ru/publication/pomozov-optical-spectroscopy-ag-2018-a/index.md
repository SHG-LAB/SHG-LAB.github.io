abstract: Plasmonic crystals is a class of periodically (nano)- structured materials
  that reveal a number of artificial resonances associated with the surface plasmon-polariton
  (SPP) excitation. They are characterized by a resonant enhancement of optical and
  nonlinear optical effects due to electromagnetic local field amplification [1].
  A new route of the development of this area appeared as magnetic materials were
  introduced as a part of plasmonic crystals, thus forming the magneto-plasmonic crystals
  (MPC). It was recognized that under the SPP excitation, resonant enhancement of
  the magneto-optical (MO) effects is achieved as well. Taking into consideration
  that the SPP resonances are artificial, introduced by the periodicity of the plasmonic
  crystal, this provides a possibility for the control over MO resonances that is
  rather prospective for applications. Up to not, two most popular MPC structures
  were studied, that are made of a combination of a noble (plasmonic) metal and a
  magnetic dielectric, and surface gratings made of ferromagnetic metals [2]. Here
  we show that an MPC composed of nanoperforated silver layer covered by a thin permalloy
  film reveals surface plasmon polariton excitation accompanied by an appearance of
  the tunable resonance of the magneto-optical response.
