abstract: Epitaxial conducting electrodes (60-300 nm thick) of LaNiO3, La1-xKxMnO3
  and ferroelectric KNbO3 thin films were deposited by MOCVD using thd-volatile precursors
  on SrTiO3 and MgO single crystalline substrates. Influence of epitaxial strain on
  properties is discussed. Ferroelectric properties of the title heterostructures
  were characterized by hysteresis measurements, piezo-response force microscopy and
  second harmonic generation. Â© 2009 ECS - The Electrochemical Society
