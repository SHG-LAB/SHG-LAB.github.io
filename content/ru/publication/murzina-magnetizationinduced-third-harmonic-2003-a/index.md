abstract: Magnetization-induced third harmonic generation was experimentally observed
  in thin films of bismuth-doped yttrium-iron garnet. The magnitude of magnetization-induced
  nonlinear optical response was enhanced through building-in a garnet film into a
  photonic-crystal microcavity. It was shown that the observed magnetization-induced
  variations in the third-harmonic intensity were caused by the internal homodyne
  of interfering weak magnetic and strong nonmagnetic polarization components of the
  cubic nonlinearity of the garnet. (C) 2003 MAIK dqNauka/Interperiodicadq.
