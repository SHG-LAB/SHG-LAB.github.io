abstract: Hyperbolic metamaterials based on the ordered arrays of metal nanorods in
  a dielectric media are of great interest owing to new optical effects appearing
  in such artificial media. Here we study the effects in the polarization state of
  light passing through a nanocomposite material consisting of Au nanorods in porous
  alumina and a similar structure supplemented by a nanolayer of ferromagnetic nickel.
  We demonstrate that close to the epsilon-near-zero dispersion point, under the transition
  to the hyperbolic dispersion region, the nanocomposites reveal anomalously high
  modulation of the polarization state of light, which appears as polarization plane
  rotation and ellipticity changes of probing radiation with a zero ellipticity. This
  effect is applied for the giant enhancement of the Faraday effect in a continuous
  ferromagnetic film staying in contact with hyperbolic material. These findings open
  a path for the design of polarization state control by using hyperbolic metamaterials.
