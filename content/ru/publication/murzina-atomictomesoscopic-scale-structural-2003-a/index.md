abstract: Structural features of diamondlike metal-doped carbon films are studied
  by means of optical second-harmonic generation (SHG). A high interfacial sensitivity
  of the SHG probe and its significant enhancement in metal nanoparticles allows one
  to distinguish between clusterlike and amorphous atomic scale structure of carbon-metal
  composites. These films appear to retain a stable amorphous atomic-scale structure
  in a wide range of metal concentration above the percolation threshold. Atomic-to-mesoscopic
  scale structural transition in diamondlike metaldoped carbon films is observed,
  which takes place under the thermal annealing. (C) 2003 American Institute of Physics.
