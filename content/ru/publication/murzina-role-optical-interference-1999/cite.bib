 abstract = {The role of optical interference in magnetization-induced effects in second-harmonic generation (SHG) is studied for magnetic nanostructures. The degree of magnetization-induced effects is governed by the fine-structure parameter and is subsequently small in low-order susceptibilities, yet enhanced at higher orders. One of the mechanisms of the enhancement of magnetization-induced contributions to the SHG intensity is related to the optical interference in the far-field region of the second-harmonic fields generated by nonmagnetic and magnetization-induced nonlinear polarizations. The model of interference is considered for resonant and off-resonant conditions in non-centro-symmetric media. This model is used for interpretation of experimental results of magnetization-induced SHG studies of Co nanocrystals and Gd monolayers.},
