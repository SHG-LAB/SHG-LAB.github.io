abstract: We study the light transmission through absorbing one-dimensional photonic
  crystals in the Laue diffraction scheme. The considered structure is designed to
  demonstrate topological phase transition associated with the changing of the symmetry
  of the eigenmodes of the electromagnetic field. We show that photonic crystal demonstrates
  enhanced transmission and pronounced features of the frequency-angle transmission
  spectrum associated with the band inversion.
