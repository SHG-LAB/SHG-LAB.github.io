 abstract = {Resonant optical properties of the magnetoplasmonic crystals, which support propagation of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) accompanied by magnetooptical effects, have found success in magnetic field driven control of optical radiation. In this work we investigate the resonant magnetooptical effects in the second harmonic generation in the magnetoplasmonic crystal formed by gold/pemalloy bifilm covering dielectric grating. Strong transverse magnetooptical Kerr with the contrast up to 30% is revealed in the spectral vicinity of the SPP excitation.},
