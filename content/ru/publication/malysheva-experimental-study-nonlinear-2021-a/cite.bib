 abstract = {Nanophotonics is a rapidly developing branch of physics that studies light interaction with nanoscaled objects such as metamaterials. Hyperbolic metamaterials (HMMs) based on ordered arrays of metal nanorods embedded in a dielectric matrix are of great interest due to their nontrivial optical properties and abilities to control over the parameters of light. In this article, we present the results of nonlinear absorbtion measurements in HMMs based on ordered arrays of silver nanorods. The main finding consists in the spectral vicinity of Epsilon-Near-Zero and Epsilon-Near-Pole features.},
