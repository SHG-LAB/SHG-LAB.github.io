abstract: Influence of chirality on the optical second harmonic generated from planar
  array of G-shaped metamaterials is studied. Circular dichroism of these nanostructures
  manifests itself via different efficiency of left and right circularly polarized
  second harmonic that is observed for the samples of different handedness. This difference
  allows to distinguish between the two enantiomers.
