 abstract = {Optical second-harmonic generation (SHG) is used as a noninvasive probe of two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectricity in Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of the copolymer vinylidene fluoride with trifluoroethylene. The surface 2D ferroelectric - paraelectric phase transition in the topmost layer of the LB films and a thickness-independent (almost 2D) transition in the bulk of these films are observed in temperature studies of SHG.
