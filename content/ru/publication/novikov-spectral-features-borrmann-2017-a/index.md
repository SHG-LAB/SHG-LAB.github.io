abstract: 'The Borrmann effect is the fundamental effect in X-ray physics. It is a
  strong increase of the transmission of a perfect crystal when the X-rays satisfy
  the Bragg diffraction condition, originating from X-rays localization between the
  atomic planes in that case. In other words, the Borrmann effect manifests itself
  by smaller field losses as the Bragg diffraction law is attained. Following the
  trend of the transfer of the X-ray phenomena into the optical spectral range, in
  this work we experimentally observed and studied the optical analog of the Borrmann
  effect for the case of one-dimensional photonic crystals (PhCs). The studies are
  performed in the Laue diffraction scheme when no photonic band gaps appear and the
  light does not experience diffraction-induced light attenuation. We studied the
  samples of PhCs based on porous fused silica. Samplesâ€™ manufacturing consists of
  two stages. First, porous silicon PhCs are fabricated by electrochemical etching
  of p-doped Si (100) wafer. The PhCs consist of alternating layers of two types,
  of high and low porosity, characterized by different refractive indexes. The second
  stage consists in annealing of the crystals in a muffle at 750o C. Depending on
  the oxidation time, we obtained the PhCs that are partially or fully annealed. The
  PhCs produced by both techniques have periodical modulation of refractive indexes
  and losses. Optical losses in the two types of PhCs are different; in partially
  annealed PhCs (PhC-I) high refractive index layers absorb light due to the presence
  of residual silicon, while in fully annealed structures (PhC-II) the losses are
  determined by light scattering in layers with high porosity (low refractive index
  layers). PhCs have several hundreds of layers that allow study the effect in the
  Laue scheme of diffraction. Optical experimental setup is based on a CW laser operating
  at the wavelength of 720-890 nm, its linearly polarized beam is focused by a lens
  on the PhC input edge of the into a spot of 130 nm. The silicon photodiode with
  a large detection region is placed close to the PhC output edge, so the total transmission
  is measured, including the beams of all diffraction maxima. We studied the transmission
  of the two types of PhCs as a function of the angle of incidence of the radiation.
  We observe that the transmission of the PhC-I samples demonstrates sharp peaks,
  corresponding to the Bragg angles of diffraction. The appearance of these peaks
  manifests of the Borrmann effect due to the predominant localization of the optical
  field in the PhC layers with low absorption. At the same time, the PhC-II structures
  demonstrate nearly monotonic decreasing of transmission as a function of the angle
  of incidence. So the effect is different for the structures with light losses in
  high or low refractive index layers. Spectral dependence of the effect shows a number
  of peculiarities: alternating appearance and disappearance of total transmission
  maxima and a strong angular narrowing of maxima for definite wavelengths. Interrelation
  of the observed effects with degeneracies of the PhC band structure is confirmed
  by theoretical calculations.'
