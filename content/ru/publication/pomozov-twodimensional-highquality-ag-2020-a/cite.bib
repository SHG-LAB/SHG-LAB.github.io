 abstract = {We demonstrate a perspective approach for the fabrication of functional high-quality magnetoplasmonic crystals based on a 2D periodical perforated silver film covered by a thin layer of ferromagnetic metal (Permalloy). The wavelength-angular spectra of the 2D crystals reveal a large number of high-quality resonant features associated with the excitation of surface plasmon-polariton modes of various orders. Due to the presence of a ferromagnetic material on both plasmonic interfaces, pronounced magnetic effects are observed for all excitations and are influenced by the coupling between various modes. The suggested magnetoplasmonic crystal composition with high-quality resonant optical and magneto-optical properties gives perspective for the control over the light propagation as well as for sensor applications.},
