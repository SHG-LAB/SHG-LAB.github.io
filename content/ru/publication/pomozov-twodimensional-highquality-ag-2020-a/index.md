abstract: We demonstrate a perspective approach for the fabrication of functional
  high-quality magnetoplasmonic crystals based on a 2D periodical perforated silver
  film covered by a thin layer of ferromagnetic metal (Permalloy). The wavelength-angular
  spectra of the 2D crystals reveal a large number of high-quality resonant features
  associated with the excitation of surface plasmon-polariton modes of various orders.
  Due to the presence of a ferromagnetic material on both plasmonic interfaces, pronounced
  magnetic effects are observed for all excitations and are influenced by the coupling
  between various modes. The suggested magnetoplasmonic crystal composition with high-quality
  resonant optical and magneto-optical properties gives perspective for the control
  over the light propagation as well as for sensor applications.
