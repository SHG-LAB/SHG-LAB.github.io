abstract: In this work, we present the results on the fabrication and characterization
  of the structural and optical properties of thick mesoporous silicon-based 1D photonic
  crystals (PC) containing up to 2500 periods (400 Î¼m thick) made by electrochemical
  etching in the hydrofluoric acid solution. The composition of multilayered structures
  with good spatial periodicity up to thousands of layers and with good reproducibility
  of porosity of alternate layers is demonstrated that is proven by SEM measurements.
  Comparative studies of the reflectivity spectra from the front and back sides of
  a thick free-standing PC also testify a good periodicity of the multilayer structure
  which manifests itself by the appearance of the photonic band gaps. We demonstrate
  that the main mechanism that restricts the fabrication of thick porous silicon-based
  photonic crystals is the local decreasing of the HF concentration in pores.
