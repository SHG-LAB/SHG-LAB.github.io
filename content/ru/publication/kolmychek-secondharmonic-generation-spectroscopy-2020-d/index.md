abstract: The interest in hyperbolic metamaterials is fueled by fascinating optical
  properties exhibited by this class of artificial media. Their optical features originate
  from hyperbolic dispersion emerging due to the shape anisotropy of the metalâ€“dielectric
  composite. In this work, we study experimentally and numerically the second-harmonic
  generation (SHG) in ordered arrays of Au nanorods embedded in porous aluminum oxide.
  Strong increase of the SHG intensity in the vicinity of the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ)
  spectral point accompanied by dramatic phase modulation of the SHG wave is revealed.
  These effects are attributed to resonant enhancement of the electric field of the
  light wave and transition from the elliptical to hyperbolic dispersion law in hyperbolic
  metamaterials near the ENZ point.
