 abstract = {We study theoretically the spectra of second, third and fourth harmonics from multimode bright squeezed vacuum obtained by type-I broadband high-gain parametric down conversion. The different contributions to the spectra of harmonics are analyzed. A new method for the measurement of second-order correlation function of parametric down conversion radiation is suggested.},
