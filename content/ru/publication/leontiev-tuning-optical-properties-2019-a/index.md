abstract: Porous films of anodic aluminum oxide are widely used as templates for the
  electrochemical preparation of functional nanocomposites containing ordered arrays
  of anisotropic nanostructures. In these structures, the volume fraction of the inclusion
  phase, which strongly determines the functional properties of the nanocomposite,
  is equal to the porosity of the initial template. For the range of systems, the
  most pronounced effects and the best functional properties are expected when the
  volume fraction of metal is less than 10%, whereas the porosity of anodic aluminum
  oxide typically exceeds this value. In the present work, the possibility of the
  application of anodic aluminum oxide for obtaining hyperbolic metamaterials in the
  form of nanocomposites with the metal volume fraction smaller than the template
  porosity is demonstrated for the first time. A decrease in the fraction of the pores
  accessible for electrodeposition is achieved by controlled blocking of the portion
  of pores during anodization when the template is formed. The effectiveness of the
  proposed approach has been shown in the example of obtaining nanocomposites containing
  Au nanorods arrays. The possibility for the control over the position of the resonance
  absorption band corresponding to the excitation of collective longitudinal oscillations
  of the electron gas in the nanorods in a wide range of wavelengths by controlled
  decreasing of the metal volume fraction, is shown.
