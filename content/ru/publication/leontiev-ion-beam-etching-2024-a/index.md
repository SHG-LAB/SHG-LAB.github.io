abstract: 'Porous anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) is widely used as a template for the
  electrodeposition of ordered arrays of one-dimensional nanostructures. Prior to
  template filling, the barrier layer, which blocks the pores at their bases, should
  be removed. However, the increase in AAO porosity during wet-chemical etching of
  the barrier layer is unavoidable that can limit further application of the templates.
  In this study, we report the kinetics of ion beam etching of the AAO barrier layer
  and the application of the technique for preparing AAO templates with the lowest
  possible porosity: 8% for the AAO films obtained in 0.3 M oxalic acid at 40 V. The
  fabrication of Au nanorod-based hyperbolic metamaterials (HMMs) with a certain spectral
  position of epsilon-near-zero point is demonstrated. Transmission spectra measurement
  and simulation give self-consistent values of gold volume fraction in the range
  from 7.3% to 8.4% confirming the high reproducibility of the proposed technique
  for AAO barrier layer etching. Such low volume fraction of metal makes Au nanorod-based
  HMMs promising candidates for the use in nanophotonic devices with tunable properties
  that are sensitive to the geometrical parameters of the structural elements. HMMs
  prepared using templates after chemical etching of the barrier layer possess a higher
  metal volume fraction and demonstrate a weaker dependence of the ENZ position on
  the nanorod length.'
