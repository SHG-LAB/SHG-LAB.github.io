abstract: Optical second harmonic generation (SHG) in the lamellar ferrielectric CuInP2S6
  is studied for the first time. Samples synthesized by conventional high-temperature
  (HT) and room temperature solution-chemistry (SC) methods were used. SHG intensity
  measurements on a single crystal HT sample reveal a transition temperature T-c =
  313 +/- 2 K and a thermal dependence similar to that of the calculated spontaneous
  polarization; the frequency conversion efficiency is 26 times that of Y-cut quartz.
  A comparative study of HT and SC pressed-powder pellets suggests that short-range
  electric dipole order is associated with limited correlation lengths in the latter.
  Evidence is also given for a phase transition at 309 K in the SC sample. (C) 2000
