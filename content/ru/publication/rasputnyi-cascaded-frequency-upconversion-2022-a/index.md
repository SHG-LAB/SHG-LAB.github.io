abstract: High-gain parametric down-conversion (PDC) is inevitably accompanied by
  cascaded up-conversion (CUpC) of PDC radiation in a nonlinear crystal even if CUpC
  is nonphase matched. Here we study experimentally and theoretically the spectral
  properties of broadband phase-matched and nonphase-matched CUpC radiation in a beta
  barium borate (BBO) crystal. Our calculations of the normalized second-order correlation
  function predict the super-bunching of CUpC radiation.
