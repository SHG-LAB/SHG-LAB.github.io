abstract: The reflected second harmonic (SH) intensity is established to be a quadratic
  function of voltage applied to the smooth silver-electrolyte interface in a wide
  range of angles of incidence of the fundamental radiation. The nonlinear reduction
  problem is solved to recapture the voltage dependence of Rudnick-Sternâ€™s parameter
  alpha(phi) that turns out to be linear in the range from -0.5 to -1.2 V (versus
  saturated Ag-AgCl electrode). In this range, the electro-induced nonlinearity of
  conduction electrons is the predominant mechanism behind the electric-field-induced
  SH. The deviations from linear dependence of alpha(phi) are associated with the
  specific adsorption of anions.
