abstract: We demonstrate enhancement of second-harmonic generation efficiency in sub-wavelength
  resonant nanostructures supporting optically induced magnetic response. This is
  achieved through simultaneous excitation of electric and magnetic multipoles at
  the second-harmonic wavelength and their constructive interference.
