abstract: Plasmonic crystals are an important backbone of modern photonics offering
  versatile control of light via manipulation of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs).
  In particular, they sustain resonant light localization near the metal surface resulting
  in the enhancement of magneto-optical effects and nonlinear optical phenomena, the
  bridge of which is appealing for sensing and light routing. In this work we investigate
  the resonant SPP-driven enhancement of the transverse magneto-optical Kerr effect
  and the second harmonic generation under the conical diffraction of light in a one-dimensional
  magnetoplasmonic crystal (MPC) based on the combination of gold and ferromagnetic
  permalloy films. We demonstrate an extra way for the control over the magneto-optical
  effects in the MPC via the magnetic anisotropy of corrugated ferromagnetic film
  in the structure of the MPC.
