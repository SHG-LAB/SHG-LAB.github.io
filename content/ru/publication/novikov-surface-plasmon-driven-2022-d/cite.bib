 abstract = {Plasmonic crystals are an important backbone of modern photonics offering versatile control of light via manipulation of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). In particular, they sustain resonant light localization near the metal surface resulting in the enhancement of magneto-optical effects and nonlinear optical phenomena, the bridge of which is appealing for sensing and light routing. In this work we investigate the resonant SPP-driven enhancement of the transverse magneto-optical Kerr effect and the second harmonic generation under the conical diffraction of light in a one-dimensional magnetoplasmonic crystal (MPC) based on the combination of gold and ferromagnetic permalloy films. We demonstrate an extra way for the control over the magneto-optical effects in the MPC via the magnetic anisotropy of corrugated ferromagnetic film in the structure of the MPC.},
