abstract: Magnetic nanostructures reveal unique interface induced properties that
  differ from those of bulk materials, thus magnetization distributions in interface
  regions are of high interest. Meanwhile, direct measurement of magnetization distribution
  in layered nanostructures is a complicated task. Here we study magnetic field induced
  effects in optical second harmonic generation (SHG) in three-layer ferromagnetic
  / heavy metals nano films. For a certain experimental geometry, which excludes the
  appearance of magnetooptical effects for homogeneously magnetized structures, magnetization
  induced SHG intensity variation is observed. Symmetry analysis of the SHG intensity
  dependencies on external magnetic field shows that the nonlinear source terms proportional
  to the out-of-plane gradient component of magnetization govern the observed effect.
