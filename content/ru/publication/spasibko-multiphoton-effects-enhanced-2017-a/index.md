abstract: The rate of an n-photon effect generally scales as the nth order autocorrelation
  function of the incident light, which is high for light with strong photon-number
  fluctuations. Therefore, “noisy” light sources are much more efficient for multiphoton
  effects than coherent sources with the same mean power, pulse duration, and repetition
  rate. Here we generate optical harmonics of the order of 2–4 from a bright squeezed
  vacuum, a state of light consisting of only quantum noise with no coherent component.
  We observe up to 2 orders of magnitude enhancement in the generation of optical
  harmonics due to ultrafast photon-number fluctuations. This feature is especially
  important for the nonlinear optics of fragile structures, where the use of a noisy
  pump can considerably increase the effect without overcoming the damage threshold.
