 annote = {Recent technological achievements provide unique possibilities for the composition of arrays of nanostructures with desired properties, nowadays referred to as metamaterials, that are perspective for various applications. A special place here belongs to chiral nanostructures that could compete with the natural materials both in efficiency and size of functional elements. For the case of metamaterials, optical activity originates from a special shape of the elements and their arrangement within an array. This research field has been actively developing over the last years and significant values of chirality effects were observed in the linear-optical response of metallic nanostructures [1]. Furthermore, chirality effects are more pronounced in the nonlinear-optical response of such structures [2,3], the latter being governed to a great extent by the local field distribution inside the metal nanostructures. In this talk we will focus mostly on the recent results on the linear and nonlinear optical effects in planar arrays of chiral nanostructures with the shape of a flat spiral (G-shaped nanostructures).},
