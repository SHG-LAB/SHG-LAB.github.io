 annote = {Composite magnetic nanostructures are a subject of high research interest, as they provide a number of exciting effects absent in live nature. Among others, much attention has been paid to the studies of exchange coupling in antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic (AFM/FM) films, which leads to the pinning effect. It manifests itself as a widening and shift of the magnetic hysteresis loop with respect to zero value of the external magnetic field oriented along the pinning direction. In this work, we report on comparative studies of linear and nonlinear magneto-optical effects under the laser-induced switching of the pinning effect in IrMn/CoFe films of various thickness of the ferromagnetic CoFe layer. We found that the magneto-optical response of the pinned AFM/FM nanofilms appears with different hysteresis loop parameters in the transverse magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) and interface-sensitive magnetization-induced second harmonic generation (SHG), indicating the diversity of the magnetic effects at interfaces compared to the bulk of the films.},
