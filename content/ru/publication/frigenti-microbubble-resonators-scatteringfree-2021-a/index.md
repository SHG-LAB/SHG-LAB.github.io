abstract: We present a proof-of-concept experiment where the absorbance spectra of
  suspensions of plasmonic nanoparticles are accurately reconstructed through the
  photothermal conversion that they mediate in a microbubble resonator. This thermal
  detection produces spectra that are insensitive towards light scattering in the
  sample, as proved experimentally by comparing the spectra of acqueos gold nanorods
  suspensions in the presence or absence of milk powder. In addition, the microbubble
  system allows for the interrogation of small samples (below 40 nl) while using a
  low-intensity beam (around 20 ÂµW) for their excitation. In perspective, this system
  could be implemented for the characterization of turbid biological fluids through
  their optical absorption, especially when considering that the microbubble resonator
  naturally interfaces to a microfluidic circuit and may easily fit within portable
  or on-chip devices.
