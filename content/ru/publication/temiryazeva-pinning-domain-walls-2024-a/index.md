abstract: Rare-earth iron garnet epitaxial films famous for their unique magnetic,
  microwave and optical properties consistently attract high interest. Domain structure
  of both bulk and interfaces of garnet films is closely connected with their magnetic
  properties and magnetization dynamics. In this work, we investigate the magnetic
  behaviour and domain structure of an epitaxial bismuth-substituted lutetium iron
  garnet film with a regular array of planar submicron particles made of Co film or
  Co/Pt multilayer on its surface. Optical polarization microscopy and magnetic force
  microscopy techniques used for the characterization of these composite structures
  confirm the mutual influence of the garnet and metal nanostructured layers on each
  other. On the one hand, dense ordered metal particles provide the pinning of the
  surface magnetic domains of the garnet film, which further affects the organization
  of the bulk stripe domains. On the other hand, we observed that the domain structure
  in the metallic pattern is governed by the domain structure of the garnet placed
  beneath it.
