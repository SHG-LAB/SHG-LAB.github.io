abstract: We present the realization of the multiperiodic optical pendulum effect
  in 1D porous silicon photonic crystals (PhCs) under dynamical Bragg diffraction
  in the Laue scheme. The diffraction-thick PhC contained 360 spatial periods with
  a large variation of the refractive index of adjacent layers of 0.4. The experiments
  reveal switching of the light leaving the PhC between the two spatial directions,
  which correspond to Laue diffraction maxima, as the fundamental wavelength or polarization
  of the incident light is varied. A similar effect can be achieved when the temperature
  of the sample or the intensity of the additional laser beam illuminating the crystal
  are changed. We show that in our PhC structures, the spectral period of the pendulum
  effect is down to 5,nm, while the thermal period is about 10,$^âˆ˜$C.
