abstract: Magnetic field induced effects in the second-harmonic generation in a thin
  asymmetric Ta/Co/Pt trilayer film with in-plane magnetic anisotropy are investigated.
  It is shown that the rotation of the polarization plane of the second-harmonic wave
  in the longitudinal magneto-optical Kerr effect configuration is as large as 37$âˆ˜$,
  which corresponds to a relative contribution from the magnetic field induced component
  of the second-harmonic field of about 30% and significantly exceeds the magnitude
  of the same effect for Co/Pt bilayer structures. It is shown that magnetization
  reversal in the Ta/Co/Pt structure occurs via the rotation of the magnetization
  vector within the film plane, and its direction is determined by the orientation
  of the easy magnetization axis of the structure relative to the applied field. The
  odd in magnetization contribution is experimentally observed in the intensity of
  the second harmonic in the longitudinal Kerr effect geometry, although it is forbidden
  by symmetry for the surfaces of uniformly magnetized structures.
