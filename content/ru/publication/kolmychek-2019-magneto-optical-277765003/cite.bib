 abstract = {The results of synthesis and experimental study of two types of nanocomposites based on Au/Ni nanorods in porous anodic alumina matrix are presented. The existence of two features in the optical spectra of such structures corresponding epsilon-near-zero and epsilon-near-pole points is shown. A significant modulation and enhancement of the alternating magneto-optical effects are observed in the spectral vicinity of these points},
