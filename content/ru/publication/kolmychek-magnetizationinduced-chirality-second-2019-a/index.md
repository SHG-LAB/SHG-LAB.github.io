abstract: Magnetization-induced circular dichroism (CD) in optical second harmonic
  generation (SHG) is observed in planar symmetrical arrays of U-shaped permalloy
  nanostructures. We demonstrate that extrinsic chirality of an array leads to the
  CD effect that strongly depends on the azimuthal orientation of the sample. In the
  absence of magnetization, the value of the SHG CD effect averaged over 2$Ï€$ azimuthal
  angle is zero, while up to 6% averaged SHG CD appears as the dc magnetic field is
  applied along the symmetry axis of the structure. Importantly the averaged SHG CD
  effect changes its sign under the reversal of the magnetic field, which corresponds
  to the appearance of magnetization driven true chirality in an array of symmetric
  magnetic nanostructures.
