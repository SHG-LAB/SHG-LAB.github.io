 abstract = {Magnetization-induced circular dichroism (CD) in optical second harmonic generation (SHG) is observed in planar symmetrical arrays of U-shaped permalloy nanostructures. We demonstrate that extrinsic chirality of an array leads to the CD effect that strongly depends on the azimuthal orientation of the sample. In the absence of magnetization, the value of the SHG CD effect averaged over 2$Ï€$ azimuthal angle is zero, while up to 6% averaged SHG CD appears as the dc magnetic field is applied along the symmetry axis of the structure. Importantly the averaged SHG CD effect changes its sign under the reversal of the magnetic field, which corresponds to the appearance of magnetization driven true chirality in an array of symmetric magnetic nanostructures.},
