abstract: Magnetization-induced effects in the symmetry properties of optical second
  harmonic generation (SHG) are studied in thin cobalt films. We demonstrate that
  the application of an external magnetic field leads to the appearance of a strong
  SHG azimuthal anisotropy from the isotropic Au/Co structure. Symmetry analysis of
  the SHG dependencies, supported by the SHG interferometry measurements, indicates
  that the effective magnetic and crystallographic second-order susceptibilities are
  both of the same order of magnitude. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
