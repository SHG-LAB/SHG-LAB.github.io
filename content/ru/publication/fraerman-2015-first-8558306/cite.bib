 abstract = {Linear and nonlinear optical properties of a thin planar CoFe∕Al2O3∕CoFe structure for different angles of incidence
of the fundamental radiation are studied by means of the magneto-optical Kerr effect and magnetizationinduced
second-harmonic generation (SHG). The composition of this multilayered structure supports the appearance
of the antiferromagnetic state, which leads to nonreciprocal optical effects and is discussed in terms of the
magnetic toroid moment. We show that in accordance with the phenomenological description, SHG magnetic
hysteresis loops for a linearly polarized pump beam are determined by linear in magnetization M components
of the SHG polarization, while for a circularly polarized pump such a description necessarily involves both linear
and quadratic in M components of the nonlinear polarization. Symmetry analysis of the magnetization-induced
SHG supports the differences between the cases of linear and circular polarization of the incident radiation observed
in the experiment, as well as a partial suppression of first in magnetization SHG contributions. Relative
values of the linear and quadratic in magnetization components of the SHG polarization are estimated for the
trilayer structure and for a reference homogeneous ferromagnetic film},
