abstract: Linear and nonlinear optical properties of a thin planar CoFe∕Al2O3∕CoFe
  structure for different angles of incidence of the fundamental radiation are studied
  by means of the magneto-optical Kerr effect and magnetizationinduced second-harmonic
  generation (SHG). The composition of this multilayered structure supports the appearance
  of the antiferromagnetic state, which leads to nonreciprocal optical effects and
  is discussed in terms of the magnetic toroid moment. We show that in accordance
  with the phenomenological description, SHG magnetic hysteresis loops for a linearly
  polarized pump beam are determined by linear in magnetization M components of the
  SHG polarization, while for a circularly polarized pump such a description necessarily
  involves both linear and quadratic in M components of the nonlinear polarization.
  Symmetry analysis of the magnetization-induced SHG supports the differences between
  the cases of linear and circular polarization of the incident radiation observed
  in the experiment, as well as a partial suppression of first in magnetization SHG
  contributions. Relative values of the linear and quadratic in magnetization components
  of the SHG polarization are estimated for the trilayer structure and for a reference
  homogeneous ferromagnetic film
