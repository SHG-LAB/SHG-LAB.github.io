abstract: Temporal Bragg diffraction-induced laser pulse splitting (DIPS) into two
  ones propagating with different group velocities is observed in multilayered linear
  photonic crystals (PC). This phenomenon originates from spatially inhomogeneous
  light localization within the PC at the Laue scheme of the dynamical Bragg diffraction.
  In a homogenous medium at the PC output each pulse is spatially separated into two
  pulses, propagating in the transmission and diffraction directions, respectively.
  The experiments are carried out for one-dimensional porous silicon-based PC consisting
  of 375 spatial periods of 800 nm thick and using a femtosecond Ti-sapphire laser
  as a probe. A linear dependence of the time splitting of each pair of transmitted
  and diffractively reflected pulses on the crystal thickness is demonstrated and
  is supported by theoretical estimations.
