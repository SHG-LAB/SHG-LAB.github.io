abstract: We study theoretically the spectra of second, third and fourth harmonics
  from multimode bright squeezed vacuum obtained by type-I broadband high-gain parametric
  down conversion. The different contributions to the spectra of harmonics are analyzed.
  A new method for the measurement of second-order correlation function of parametric
  down conversion radiation is suggested.
