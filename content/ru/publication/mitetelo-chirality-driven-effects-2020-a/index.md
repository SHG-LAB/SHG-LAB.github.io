abstract: Organic microresonators are highly attractive for numerous applications
  including biosensing,optical switching and metrology. Adding chiral materials to
  resonators can enhance theirsensing properties due to the appearance of chiroptical
  effects. Here we study experimentallyresonant multiphoton processes in spherical
  microresonators with the diameter of 2--12 $Î¼$mmade of 1,1'-bi-2-naphthol derivatives
  by a self-assembly technique. Using nonlinear singleparticlemicroscopy, we demonstrate
  that these microspheres provide excitation of whisperinggallery modes (WGMs) in
  two- and three-photon excited luminescence with a Q-factor ofup to 300. We also
  demonstrate that the nonlinear circular dichroism is enhanced due tothe WGM excitation
  and reaches 7.7% and 11% in the two- and three-photon absorption,respectively. Pronounced
  modulation of the WGMs spectrum due to the mode's splitting isobserved in coupled
  binol-based microresonators, which opens a path for the control over theirresonant
  response and makes them suitable for nonlinear optical sensing applications.
