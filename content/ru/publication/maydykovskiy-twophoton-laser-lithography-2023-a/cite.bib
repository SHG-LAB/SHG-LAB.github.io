 abstract = {The development and optimization of methods for creating functional elements of micron and sub-micron sizes for photonic integrated circuits is one of the main tasks of nanophotonics. Two-photon laser lithography is actively developing now to form three-dimensional structures with subwave resolution. Results of this development are reported and it is shown that the use of optimized lithography schemes, the spatial filtering of laser beam used, and the introduction of laser dyes into polymer lead to the formation of optically homogeneous high-quality bulk microstructures with characteristic features down to 300 nm with necessary functional properties. The capabilities of optimized two-photon laser lithography are demonstrated by examples of ring microcavities and optical waveguides with prism input/output adapters located above a substrate. Optical losses upon the coupling of 405-nm radiation into a waveguide using a printed prism adapter was no more than 1.25 dB.},
