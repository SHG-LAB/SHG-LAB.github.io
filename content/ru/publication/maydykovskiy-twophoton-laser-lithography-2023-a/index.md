abstract: The development and optimization of methods for creating functional elements
  of micron and sub-micron sizes for photonic integrated circuits is one of the main
  tasks of nanophotonics. Two-photon laser lithography is actively developing now
  to form three-dimensional structures with subwave resolution. Results of this development
  are reported and it is shown that the use of optimized lithography schemes, the
  spatial filtering of laser beam used, and the introduction of laser dyes into polymer
  lead to the formation of optically homogeneous high-quality bulk microstructures
  with characteristic features down to 300 nm with necessary functional properties.
  The capabilities of optimized two-photon laser lithography are demonstrated by examples
  of ring microcavities and optical waveguides with prism input/output adapters located
  above a substrate. Optical losses upon the coupling of 405-nm radiation into a waveguide
  using a printed prism adapter was no more than 1.25 dB.
