abstract: Artificial hyperbolic metamaterials (HMM) are perspective for the nonlinear
  optical applications, their exciting functionality being due to the hyperbolic dispersion
  induced by a strong shape anisotropy. Here we study the second harmonic generation
  (SHG) in HMM formed by arrays of silver nanorods in anodic alumina. In the hyperbolic
  dispersion regime, giant SHG is observed associated with the fulfillment of the
  phase-matching conditions supported by the epsilon-near-pole resonance at the SHG
  wavelength, and an increase in the pump field in the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) spectral
  range. We predict a strong increase in the SHG efficiency for metamaterials with
  the ENZ resonance at the second harmonic frequency.
