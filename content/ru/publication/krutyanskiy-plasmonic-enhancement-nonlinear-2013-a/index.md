abstract: Linear and nonlinear magneto-optical properties of the metamaterials based
  on nickel nanorod assemblies have been studied. The second-harmonic generation properties
  follow the effective medium description of the metamaterial as a homogeneous layer
  isotropic in the direction normal to the nanorod axes. Magneto-optical and nonlinear
  magneto-optical Kerr effects are enhanced in the vicinity of the plasmonic modes
  of Ni nanorods and of the photonic resonance of the metamaterial layer, while conventional
  (nonmagnetic) optical response does not exhibit plasmonic-related features. The
  observed surprisingly high sensitivity of magneto-optical and nonlinear magneto-optical
  responses to the metamaterial photonic modes is prospective for the diagnostics
  of plasmonic excitations in magnetic nanostructures and for possible applications
  in high density magneto-optical data storage.
