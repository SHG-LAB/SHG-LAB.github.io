abstract: A method for formation of bulk plasmonic structures based on porous quartz
  with silver nanoparticles in pores has been proposed and implemented. The spectroscopy
  of their optical and nonlinear optical properties has been performed by methods
  of second harmonic generation and two-photon absorption. A significant increase
  in the nonlinear absorption coefficient has been detected in the plasmon resonance
  region. The enhancement of the second optical harmonic has been observed with the
  shift by tens of nanometers from the plasmon resonance position toward the long-wavelength
  region.
