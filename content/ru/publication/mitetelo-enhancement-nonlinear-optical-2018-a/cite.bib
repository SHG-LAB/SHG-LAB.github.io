 abstract = {A method for formation of bulk plasmonic structures based on porous quartz with silver nanoparticles in pores has been proposed and implemented. The spectroscopy of their optical and nonlinear optical properties has been performed by methods of second harmonic generation and two-photon absorption. A significant increase in the nonlinear absorption coefficient has been detected in the plasmon resonance region. The enhancement of the second optical harmonic has been observed with the shift by tens of nanometers from the plasmon resonance position toward the long-wavelength region.},
