abstract: Optical second harmonic generation (SHG) and nonlinear magneto-optical Kerr
  effect (NOMOKE) are experimentally studied in CoxAg1-x and (CoFe)(x)(Al2O3)(1-x)
  granular films which exhibit giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect. Nonmonotonous
  dependences of the magnetoresistance, SHG intensity and NOMOKE magnetic contrast
  on volume fraction of the magnetic component x are found. The maximum of the NOMOKE
  magnetic contrast is attained at the value of x close to that providing the maximum
  of the magnetoresistance. The resonances observed in the SHG spectra are associated
  with the local surface plasmon modes at the granule/host interfaces. (C) 2001 Elsevier
