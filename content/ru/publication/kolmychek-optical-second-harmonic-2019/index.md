abstract: Magnetic planar nanostructures composed of ferromagnetic and heavy metals
  are a subject of intensive studies during the last years. Here we apply the technique
  of optical second harmonic generation (SHG) to the studies of planar nanostructures
  based on such materials, where the high sensitivity of the SHG probe to the spatial
  and temporal symmetry breaking is of principal importance. Based on the analysis
  of the SHG magnetic field dependencies, we show a clear difference of the magnetic
  behavior of the interfaces and of bulky materials, as well as additional features
  attributed to specific interfacial chiral magnetization distributions.
