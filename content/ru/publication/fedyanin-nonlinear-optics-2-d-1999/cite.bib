 abstract = {Structural and magnetic properties of superstructure consisting of 2D layers of magnetic Gd ions are studied by second harmonic generation (SHG). The incoherent SHG (hyper-Rayleigh scattering) as well as magnetization induced effects in SHG interferometry and second harmonic (SH) polarization diagrams indicate that GD monolayers consist of 2D islands with noncompensated magnetic moment. The periodic structure of Gd layers is confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. The SHG studies were performed using an output of a nanosecond YAG:Nd3+ laser operating at the wavelength of 1064 nm.},
