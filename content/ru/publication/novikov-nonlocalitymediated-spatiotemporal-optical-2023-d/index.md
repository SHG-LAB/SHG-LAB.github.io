abstract: Optical vortices have myriad applications in photonics. Very recently, promising
  concepts of spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) pulses based on the phase helicity
  in the spaceâ€“time coordinates have attracted much attention owing to their donut
  shape. We elaborate on the molding of STOV under the transmission of femtosecond
  pulses through a thin epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) metamaterial slab based on a silver
  nanorod array in a dielectric host. At the heart of the proposed approach is the
  interference of the so-called main and additional optical waves enabled by strong
  optical nonlocality of these ENZ metamaterials, which leads to the appearance of
  phase singularities in transmission spectra. The cascaded metamaterial structure
  is proposed for high-order STOV generation.
