abstract: The films containing core (shell) $γ$-Fe2O3 (Au) nanoparticles that possess
  the plasmon resonance at the wavelength 550 nm are prepared. The second harmonic
  generation in these structures is shown to be diffuse and depolarized, that is typical
  for the hyper-Rayleigh scattering.. The studies of the magnetization-induced second
  harmonic generation shows that the ratio of the magnetic to nonmagnetic components
  of the hyperpolarizability of a single nanoparticle, $γ$M/$γ$0 ~ 0.4 in the field
  of about 3 kOe.
