 abstract = {The films containing core (shell) $γ$-Fe2O3 (Au) nanoparticles that possess the plasmon resonance at the wavelength 550 nm are prepared. The second harmonic generation in these structures is shown to be diffuse and depolarized, that is typical for the hyper-Rayleigh scattering.. The studies of the magnetization-induced second harmonic generation shows that the ratio of the magnetic to nonmagnetic components of the hyperpolarizability of a single nanoparticle, $γ$M/$γ$0 ~ 0.4 in the field of about 3 kOe.},
