abstract: The ferroelectric phase transition on the free surface of a polymer ferroelectric
  Langmuir-Blodgett film was studied by the optical second harmonic generation (SHG)
  technique. A hysteresis in the temperature dependence of the SHG intensity observed
  for a multilayer film of a poly(vinylidene fluoride)-trifluoroethylene copolymer
  in the vicinity of T approximate to 15degreesC is a manifestation of the first-order
  ferroelectric phase transition in the topmost surface monolayer of the film. (C)
