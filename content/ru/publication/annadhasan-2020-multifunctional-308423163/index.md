abstract: Two chiral π‐conjugated polymers with optical nonlinearity (NLO), abbreviated
  as R‐ and S‐BP , are prepared by copolymerization of R‐ and S‐6,6'‐dibromo‐2,2'‐diethoxy‐1,1'‐binaphthyl
  with 1,4‐diethynyl‐2,5‐bis(octyloxy)benzene by Sonogashira coupling. The R‐ and
  S‐BP copolymers self‐assemble in a tetrahydrofuran/H2O/ethanol mixture producing
  microspherical particles. Remarkably, the obtained polymer microspheres support
  excitation of whispering gallery mode resonances (500–720 nm) in one‐ and two‐photon
  excited luminescence or two‐photon luminescence (TPL) with a quality factor (Q )
  of up to ≈700. As a result of a high Q value, a single (R‐ or S‐BP ) microsphere
  displays a circular dichroism (CD) effect in the TPL signal. At high laser pump‐power
  (≥10 mW), the TPL spectral features of microspheres change significantly, suggesting
  alterations of the polymer packing. Similar spectral variations are observed for
  microspheres heated thermally or with high power continuous‐wave laser. Photoluminescence
  lifetime imaging microscopy down to the single microsphere level corroborate transformations
  of polymer packing from a J type to a mixture of J , H , and H‐like (with disordered
  side chains) types. This work demonstrates the tremendous potential of tailor‐made
  chiral polymer microspheres exhibiting multifunctional properties, such as i) light‐confinement,
  ii) NLO‐CD, and iii) laser‐driven optical emission shifts, useful for many optoelectronic
  and photonic device applications.
