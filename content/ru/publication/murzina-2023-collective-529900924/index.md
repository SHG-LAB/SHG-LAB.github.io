abstract: Compact planar photonic elements serving for efficient control over the
  polarization of light are of paramount importance in photonics. Here, we propose
  a design of a chiral periodic metasurface based on plasmonic nanodisks and nanorods
  arranged asymmetrically in a unit cell. Using the finite-difference time-domain
  analysis, we show that the collective lattice resonance harnessed by the diffraction
  coupling of the plasmonic unit cells is the heart of the revealed resonant 38% circular
  dichroism effect. The circular dichroism enhancement of the considered structure
  is improved using the deep-learning-assisted optimization of the metasurface design.
