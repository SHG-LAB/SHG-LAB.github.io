abstract: We present experimental and theoretical studies of the anomalous high transmission
  of light (the Borrmann effect) under the Laue diffraction in a one-dimensional photonic
  crystal (PhC) characterized by spatial modulation of both refractive index and absorption.
  We show that a strong modulation of the refractive index along with the large PhC
  period provide new features of the Borrmann effect as compared to the well-known
  x-ray Borrmann effect in crystals appearing in PhC wavelength-angular transmission
  spectra. Namely, the maximal transmission is attained at the Bragg angles of incidence
  and corresponds alternatively to even or odd orders of the Bragg angles depending
  on the light wavelength. Second, a dramatic decrease of the angular width of the
  high transmission areas in the spectrum appear near the diabolic points. According
  to our description, this effect can be treated as a result of the topological phase
  transition accompanied by exchange of the parity of spatial distribution of the
  electromagnetic field of the two eigenmodes experiencing degeneracy. We demonstrate
  that these peculiarities are inherent to the PhC with the optical losses located
  in layers with higher refractive index, and disappear if the losses are specific
  for the PhC layers with lower refractive index. The suggested underlying mechanism
  involves the contribution of the waveguide PhC modes to the PhC transmission spectra.
