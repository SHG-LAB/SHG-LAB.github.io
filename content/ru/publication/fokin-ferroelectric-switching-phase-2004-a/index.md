abstract: Ferroelectric smectic C* (SmC*)-smectic A* (SmA*) phase transitions and
  ferroelectric switching in thin planar cells of chiral liquid crystals (LC) are
  studied by second harmonic generation (SHG) technique. Electric field and temperature
  dependences of reflected and transmitted SHG are studied in order to distinguish
  between non-linear optical response from the sub-surface layer and the bulk of the
  LC cell. The analysis of the SHG temperature dependences shows a strong surface
  coupling resulting in the existence of an unswitchable dqfrozendq sub-surface layer
  which retains a stable structure under the application of a DC electric field and
  temperature variations. Critical exponents in the vicinity of the ferroelectric
  phase transition show a behavior corresponding to the superfluid helium theory.
