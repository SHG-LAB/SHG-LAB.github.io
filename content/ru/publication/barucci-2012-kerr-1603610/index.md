abstract: 'Whispering-gallery-modes (WGM) spherical microresonators may reveal new
  perspective properties being coated with non-linear thin layers. We present the
  examples of all-optical switching of WGM in silica microspheres covered with a polyfluorene
  derivative showing ultrafast Kerr nonlinearity, or a relatively slow thermal nonlinearity.
  Another set of measurements performed with an inert polymer, an acrylate derivative,
  is discussed as well. '
