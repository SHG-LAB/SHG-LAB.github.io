 abstract = {A one-dimensional combined plasmonic–photonic system tailored for the enhancement of nonlinear optical effects is proposed and implemented. In this structure, a layer of silver plasmonic nanoparticles is placed in the cavity region of a photonic-crystal microcavity made of porous silicon. A multifold increase in an optical second harmonic generation signal in comparison to the structure without plasmonic nanoparticles is demonstrated.},
