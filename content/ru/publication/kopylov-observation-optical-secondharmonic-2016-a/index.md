abstract: Second-harmonic generation (SHG) in the Laue scheme of the dynamical Bragg
  diffraction in one-dimensional photonic crystal (PhC) is studied. The experiments
  are performed for partially annealed porous-silicon PhC containing 250 periods of
  the structure. Our measurements confirm that the phase-matched optical SHG is observed
  under the Bragg conditions, which is evidenced by a narrow angular and spectral
  distribution of the diffracted SHG outgoing the PhC. This is confirmed by both the
  analytical description of the SHG process performed in the two-wave approximation,
  and by direct calculations of the PhC dispersion curves for the fundamental and
  SHG wavelengths by the revised plane wave method. Possible types of phase- and quasi-phase-matching
  realized in the studied PhC under the Laue diffraction scheme are discussed.
