abstract: Optical second-harmonic (SH) generation in porous-silicon-based photonic
  microcavities is observed in the form of hyper-Rayleigh scattering (HRS), with the
  SH radiation being diffuse and depolarized. Infiltration of sodium nitrite into
  the pores essentially suppresses HRS and results in generation of specular and partially
  polarized SH. Dissimilarly, the third-harmonic (TH) radiation from both unfilled
  and infiltrated samples is specular and polarized. These results indicate different
  spatial localization of the SH and TH sources. (C) 2008 Optical Society of America
