abstract: Magnetoinduced effects in second harmonic (SH) generation are experimentally
  studied in the CoxCu1âˆ’x granular films. Significant nonlinear magneto-optical Kerr
  effect (NOMOKE) is observed both in longitudinal and transverse configurations.
  The interference of the SH fields generated by the interface and bulk, nonmagnetic
  and magnetoinduced nonlinear polarizations is discussed as a mechanism of NOMOKE
  enhancement. The bulk nonmagnetic dipole quadratic susceptibility of Co nanocrystals
  stems from the lack of inversion symmetry in the Co granules.
