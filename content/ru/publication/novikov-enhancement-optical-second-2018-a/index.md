abstract: A one-dimensional combined plasmonic–photonic system tailored for the enhancement
  of nonlinear optical effects is proposed and implemented. In this structure, a layer
  of silver plasmonic nanoparticles is placed in the cavity region of a photonic-crystal
  microcavity made of porous silicon. A multifold increase in an optical second harmonic
  generation signal in comparison to the structure without plasmonic nanoparticles
  is demonstrated.
