abstract: Photonic crystals (PCs) consisting of a periodic arrangement of holes in
  dielectric media have found success in light manipulation and sensing. Among them,
  three-dimensional (3D) PCs are in high demand due to their unique properties originating
  from multiple photonic band gaps (PBGs) and even full ones. Here, 3D PCs based on
  porous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) were fabricated for the first time. Our approach
  involves prepatterning of the aluminum surface by a focused ion beam to form a hexagonal
  array of pore nuclei. Subsequent anodization in 1 M H3PO3 using a sine wave profile
  of voltage provides AAO with a defect-free in-plane porous structure and out-of-plane
  porosity modulation. The ability to tune the position, width, and depth of the PBGs
  is demonstrated. The combination of the flexibility of the proposed approach with
  the unique properties of AAO extends the range of practical applications of 3D PCs
  far beyond the current achievements.
