abstract: Organic microstructures are well known for their resonator properties, which
  bring about whispering gallery mode (WGM) excitation. Here we report on experimental
  evidence of the WGM in the two-photon fluorescence (TPF) of DCM dye microspheres
  made using the selfassembly method. The WGM excitation accompanying the overall
  TPF in the spectral range from 530 รท 640 nm demonstrated a quality factor of approximately
  102 for spheres that were several microns in diameter. The power dependence of the
  TPF intensity proved the second order nature of the interaction process involved.
