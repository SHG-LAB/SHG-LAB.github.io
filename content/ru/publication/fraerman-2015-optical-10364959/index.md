abstract: The effects of inhomogeneous magnetization on optical second harmonic generation
  from magnetic nanostructures are studied. Cobalt triangular-shaped nanoparticles
  with vortex magnetization and magnetic trilayers that support the ferromagnetic
  phase formation are considered. We show that magnetic field dependencies of the
  SHG intensity for both types of structures reveal a number of distinct peculiarities
  associated with additional SHG mechanisms attributed to inhomogeneous magnetic state
  of the nanostructures.
