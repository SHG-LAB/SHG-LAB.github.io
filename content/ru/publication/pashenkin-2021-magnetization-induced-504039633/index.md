abstract: Magnetization-induced effects accompanying optical second harmonic generation
  (SHG) in three-layer W/Co/Pt films with different thicknesses of the cobalt layer
  (2–10 nm) induced by longitudinal magnetic field are experimentally studied. An
  odd-magnetic intensity effect in the p polarized second harmonic is found, with
  the corresponding SHG magnetic contrast increasing with the thickness of the Co
  layer SHGSHG. The effects are phenomenologically described by considering the bulk
  nonlinear polarization at the second harmonic frequency, which is proportional to
  the magnetization gradient in the direction normal to the structure, and the interface
  contribution, which is proportional to the square of the magnetization of the films.
