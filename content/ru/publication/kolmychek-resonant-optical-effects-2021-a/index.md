abstract: Plasmonic structures are extremely attractive for the light flow manipulation.
  In turn, the spectrum of the plasmon excitations can be controlled by external magnetic
  field, thus giving rise to magnetoplasmonics. However, in the case of traditional
  magnetoplasmonic structures, the enhancement of magneto-optical (MO) effects is
  often accompanied by the transmission damp, which constricts the area of their applications.
  This paper examines resonant optical effects in composite structures based on artificial
  opal films covered by a thin cobalt layer, which forms a 2D hexagonal lattice of
  nanoholes in the metal film. Such periodic structure exhibits surface plasmon polariton-assisted
  extraordinary transmission along with the increase of odd in magnetization intensity
  magnetooptical effect in the Voigt geometry. Local field enhancement accompanying
  the surface plasmon polaritons excitation in composite Co/opal structure provides
  a distinct enhancement of the magnetization-induced second harmonic generation (SHG)
  and relevant MO effects at the SHG wavelength that appear as Fano-type resonances.
  High transmission along with resonantly-high MO effects make Co/opal films promising
  in plasmonic applications.
