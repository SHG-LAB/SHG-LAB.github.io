abstract: Nonlinear magneto-optical Kerr effect in Gd-containing Langmuir-Blodgett
  superstructures is studied by second harmonic generation (SHG) interferometry. The
  intensity of the regular magneto-induced second harmonic (SH) is found to be by
  a factor of about 2 larger than the intensity of the regular SH component of a non-magnetic
  origin. The phase shift between the magneto-induced and non-magnetic contributions
  to the nonlinear polarization is about 46$âˆ˜$. The intensity of the magnetization-independent
  hyper-Rayleigh scattering (HRS) is by two orders larger than that of magneto-induced
  HRS.
