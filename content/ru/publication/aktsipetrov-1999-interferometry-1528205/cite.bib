 abstract = {Nonlinear magneto-optical Kerr effect in Gd-containing Langmuir-Blodgett superstructures is studied by second harmonic generation (SHG) interferometry. The intensity of the regular magneto-induced second harmonic (SH) is found to be by a factor of about 2 larger than the intensity of the regular SH component of a non-magnetic origin. The phase shift between the magneto-induced and non-magnetic contributions to the nonlinear polarization is about 46$âˆ˜$. The intensity of the magnetization-independent hyper-Rayleigh scattering (HRS) is by two orders larger than that of magneto-induced HRS.},
