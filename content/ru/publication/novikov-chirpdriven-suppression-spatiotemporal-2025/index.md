abstract: Spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOVs) have sparked an explosion of interest
  due to their intrinsic transverse optical angular momentum. It spurred methods of
  the STOV formation based on the application of phase masks and metasurfaces. In
  this quest, the obtained specific doughnut-shaped laser pulses suffer from the disintegration
  into optical lobes under the free-space propagation due to light diffraction. Here,
  we present a simple remedy to cure this innate flaw. We found that preliminary chirping
  of the laser pulse prevents the STOV breakup. We supported this analytically and
  gave the explicit expression of the required chirp value.
