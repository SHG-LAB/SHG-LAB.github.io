abstract: Anisotropic metal nanostructures reveal unique optical properties providing
  new optical effects. Here we study experimentally the nonlinear-optical response
  of planar arrays of gold comma-like and crescent-like nanostructures made by colloidal
  lithography. We show that anisotropy of the nonlinear-optical response is defined
  not only by the shape of the particles, but also by the relative phase of second-order
  susceptibility components, which are found to be spectrally sensitive. High values
  of circular dichroism in the second-harmonic generation response up to 70% are observed
  in comma-like nanostructures.
