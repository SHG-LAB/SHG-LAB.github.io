 abstract = {Ferroelectric properties of thin (1.5-4 mum planar cells of a ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) mixture are studied using electro-optic measurements, second-harmonic generation (SHG) and SHG interferometry. A switching behaviour of the FLC cells in external dc electric fields is observed. It is characterised by rotation of the polarisation plane of the transmitted light and by changes in the SHG intensity, phase and anisotropy dependences, which are attributed to a collective motion of the system as a ferroelectric uniform state with C-2 symmetry.},
