abstract: Second harmonic generation by a disordered array of superparamagnetic nanoparticles
  in a static magnetic field H is studied experimentally. For H = 0, only hyper-Rayleigh
  scattering takes place; i.e., the second-harmonic radiation is diffuse and unpolarized.
  For H not equal 0, a coherent (specular and linearly polarized) component appears
  against the hyper-Rayleigh scattering background. The phase of the coherent component
  changes by pi when the direction of the magnetic field is reversed. It is shown
  that the effect can be explained by correlations in the spatial fluctuations of
  the nonlinear-optical and magnetic polarizabilities of the particles, taking into
  account the nonuniformity of the effective (local) static magnetic field.
