abstract: 'A vertical hybrid microcavity is fabricated by sandwiching a polymer layer
  between distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) composed of porous silicon photonic
  crystals. The DBRs are made by electrochemical etching of Si and consist of alternating
  porous Si layers of high and low porosity, the top DBR being a freestanding film.
  The hybrid microcavity demonstrates a deep microcavity mode placed within a 200
  nm wide photonic band gap, and reveals a many-fold enhancement of the third-order
  nonlinearity of the microcavity layer. The fabrication technique employed is rather
  simple, enabling the use of a variety of functional materials as the microcavity
  spacer. (C) 2009 American Institute of Physics. [doi: 10.1063/1.3245319]'
