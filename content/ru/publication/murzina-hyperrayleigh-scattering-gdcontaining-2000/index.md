abstract: Incoherent optical second harmonic (SH) generation, or hyper-Rayleigh scattering
  (HRS), is used to study the structure and properties of Gd/C18H36O2 multilayer Langmuir-Biodgett
  (LB) films. SH reflection spectra (in combination with linear absorption spectra),
  HRS indicatrices, thickness dependence, and wave polarization diagrams are measured
  for s-polarized fundamental radiation. The SH radiation is entirely diffuse but
  pre-dominantly s polarized, with the maximum of the HRS indicatrix shifted by 8i̧rc
  relative to the specular direction, which is interpreted as being due to the contribution
  of a fluctuating quadrupole to the nonlinear-optical response of the films. The
  estimated correlation length of spatial fluctuations of the nonlinear-optical polarization
  in the film is ∼400 nm. These properties are associated with an islandlike structure
  formed by Gd ions inside LB structural units. © 2000 Optical Society of America.
