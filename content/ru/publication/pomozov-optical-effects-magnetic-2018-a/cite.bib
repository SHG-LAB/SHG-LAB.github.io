 abstract = {We present the results of synthesis of arrays of gold and bilayer Au/Ni nanorods in a matrix of porous anodic alumina and of experimental investigation and numerical simulation of their optical and magnetooptical properties. We show that the spectra of these structures have two singular features located near 520 nm and in the range of 700–800 nm. Au/Ni nanorods exhibit a significant modulation and enhancement of the magnetooptical intensity effect in the range of the long-wavelength resonance. Experimentally observed features agree with results of numerical simulation.},
