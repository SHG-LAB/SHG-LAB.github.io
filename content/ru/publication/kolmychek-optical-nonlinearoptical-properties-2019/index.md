abstract: We present the experimental results on optical an nonlinear-optical effects
  in hyperbolic media based on gold nanorods arrays in porous anodic alumina, demonstrating
  pronounced effects attributed to epsilon-near-zero and epsilon-near-pole dispersion
  points. In the spectral vicinity of the epsilon-near-zero, an enhancement of the
  optical activity and of the second harmonic intensity are observed.
