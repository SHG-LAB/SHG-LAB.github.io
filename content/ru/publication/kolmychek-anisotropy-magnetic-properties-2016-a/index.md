abstract: Anisotropy of linear and nonlinear magnetooptical (MO) effects in a regular
  array of Py antidots is studied by means of the MO Kerr effect at the fundamental
  and second harmonic wavelengths. We have demonstrated that the value of the MO effect,
  coercivity, and magnetization distribution depend substantially on the azimuthal
  orientation of the antidots array relatively to the external magnetic field.
