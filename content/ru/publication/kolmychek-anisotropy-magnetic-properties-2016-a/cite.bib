 abstract = {Anisotropy of linear and nonlinear magnetooptical (MO) effects in a regular array of Py antidots is studied by means of the MO Kerr effect at the fundamental and second harmonic wavelengths. We have demonstrated that the value of the MO effect, coercivity, and magnetization distribution depend substantially on the azimuthal orientation of the antidots array relatively to the external magnetic field.},
