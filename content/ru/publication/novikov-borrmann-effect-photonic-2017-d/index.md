abstract: We present the experimental observation of the optical Borrmann effect in
  1D porous silica-based photonic crystals (PhC) composed of several hundreds of dielectric
  layers with different porosity. Two mechanisms of the effect are demonstrated, which
  involve the optical losses associated with light scattering and absorption in nanoporous
  layers. Absorption is introduced by a small amount of silicon in partially annealed
  porous silicon PhC. We show that the PhC transmittance increases substantially under
  the Bragg diffraction condition, which is a manifestation of the Borrmann effect.
  The observed effects along with their polarization sensitivity are confirmed by
  numerical calculations.
