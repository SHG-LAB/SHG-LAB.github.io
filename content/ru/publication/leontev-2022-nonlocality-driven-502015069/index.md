abstract: The recent surge of optics of hyperbolic metamaterials (HMMs) has been fueled
  by their fascinating optical properties, one of the most intriguing being their
  strong optical nonlocality. In this work we demonstrate that in metal nanorod-based
  HMMs the nonlocality results in fast and slow light effects in the propagation of
  femtosecond laser pulses in close spectral vicinity of the HMM epsilon-near-zero
  regime. These effects are switchable via the angle of incidence and light wavelength.
  We elucidate that revealed dynamical phenomena stem from the zero-transmission points
  of HMM and related phase singularities caused by the destructive interference of
  the main optical wave and the additional wave mediated by the spatial dispersion
  of light in the HMMs.
