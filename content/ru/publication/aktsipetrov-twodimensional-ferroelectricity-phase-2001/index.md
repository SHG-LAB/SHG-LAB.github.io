abstract: Ultrathin electrode-free ferroelectric Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of polyvinylidene
  fluoride (PVDF) with trifluoroethylene are experimentally studied by means of optical
  second harmonic generation (SHG) in a temperature range from 140 K to 380 K. The
  temperature behavior of spontaneous polarization induced SHG reveals distinct features
  in the vicinity of 355 K and 295 K which can be attributed to ferroelectric-paraelectric
  phase transitions in the bulk and at the surface of this two-dimensional structures.
  Lattice-stiffening transition recently observed in PVDF LB films at 160 K does not
  show remarkable peculiarities of temperature dependence of SHG that indicates nonpolar
  changes in LB film structure under this transition.
