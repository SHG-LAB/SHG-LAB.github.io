abstract: Optical second-harmonic (SH) generation in Au/Co/Au sandwich-like nanodisks
  is studied, using several experimental techniques, at SH frequency being close to
  that of the plasmon resonance in the system. The dependences of the relative amplitude
  and phase of the magnetization-induced SH component on the angle of incidence are
  found to significantly differ from those measured for a continuous Au/Co/Au trilayer
  film. A phenomenological description of the observed effects is proposed, with special
  emphasis on resonant excitation of the local plasmon modes by the nonlinear sources
  induced in the nanodisks.
