abstract: The results of the synthesis, experimental studies, and numerical simulation
  of optical and nonlinear-optical properties of gold nanorods in porous anodic alumina
  templates are presented. Two features in the spectra of such structures in the vicinity
  of the wavelengths of 530 nm and 810 nm correspond to the epsilon-near-pole and
  epsilon-near-zero, respectively. Optical and nonlinear-optical properties of the
  structures in the spectral vicinity of these points are investigated. Experimentally
  observed features are consistent with the data of simulation.
