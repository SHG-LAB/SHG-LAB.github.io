 abstract = {The results of the synthesis, experimental studies, and numerical simulation of optical and nonlinear-optical properties of gold nanorods in porous anodic alumina templates are presented. Two features in the spectra of such structures in the vicinity of the wavelengths of 530 nm and 810 nm correspond to the epsilon-near-pole and epsilon-near-zero, respectively. Optical and nonlinear-optical properties of the structures in the spectral vicinity of these points are investigated. Experimentally observed features are consistent with the data of simulation.},
