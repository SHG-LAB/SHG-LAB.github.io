abstract: Anisotropy of the nonlinear magnetooptical (MO) response in regular arrays
  of Py antidots and flqqY̏RSfrqq-, flqqUfrqq- and flqqOfrqq- shaped Py nanoelements
  is studied by means of the MO Kerr effect at the second harmonic (SH) wavelength.
  We demonstrate that the values of the MO effect and coercivity depend substantially
  on the azimuthal orientation of the antidots array relatively to the external magnetic
  field. In the arrays of flqqy̧rcharq̏q-, flqqUfrqq- and flqqOfrqq- shaped Py nanoelements
  the circular dichroism (CD) of the SH response was observed due to the extrinsic
  chirality of the samples. We demonstrate that the averaged over the azimuthal angle
  value of the CD depends on the applied to the structure magnetic field.
