abstract: BiFeO3 thin films were grown by metal organic chemical vapour deposition
  (MOCVD) at the temperature T=700 degrees C using Fe(thd)(3), Bi (C6H5)(3) as volatile
  precursors. High thermal stability of Bi(C6H5)(3) makes the film stoichiometry very
  sensible to the deposition conditions, in particular to the precursor residence
  time in the reactor. We tested novel precursors Bi(thd)(3) and Bi(CH3COO)(3) possessing
  lower thermal stability. They drive the process into the diffusion control regime
  when cation stoichiometry in the layer is easier to control. The possibility to
  use them for epitaxial growth of BiFeO3 thin films was demonstrated. BiFeO3 film
  forms the self-organized nanodomain variant structure with (110) out-of-plane orientation
  on (001) ZrO2(Y2O3) substrate. The high resolution TEM images confirm variant domain
  structure formation. The ferroelectric nature of BiFCO3 films was assessed at the
  room temperature by piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM). (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
