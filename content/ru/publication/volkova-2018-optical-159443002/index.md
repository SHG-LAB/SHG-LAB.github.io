abstract: We present the results of synthesis of arrays of gold and bilayer Au/Ni
  nanorods in a matrix of porous anodic alumina and of experimental investigation
  and numerical simulation of their optical and magnetooptical properties. We show
  that the spectra of these structures have two singular features located near 520
  nm and in the range of 700–800 nm. Au/Ni nanorods exhibit a significant modulation
  and enhancement of the magnetooptical intensity effect in the range of the long-wavelength
  resonance. Experimentally observed features agree with results of numerical simulation.
