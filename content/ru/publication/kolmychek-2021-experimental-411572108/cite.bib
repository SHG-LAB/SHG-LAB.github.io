 annote = {Nanophotonics is a rapidly developing branch of physics that studies light interaction with
nanoscaled objects such as metamaterials. Hyperbolic metamaterials (HMMs) based on ordered arrays of
metal nanorods embedded in a dielectric matrix are of great interest due to their nontrivial optical properties
and abilities to control over the parameters of light. In this article, we present the results of nonlinear
absorbtion measurements in HMMs based on ordered arrays of silver nanorods. The main finding consists
in the spectral vicinity of Epsilon-Near-Zero and Epsilon-Near-Pole features.},
