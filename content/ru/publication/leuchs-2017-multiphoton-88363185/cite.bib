 annote = {The rate of an n-photon effect generally scales as the nth order autocorrelation function of the incident
light, which is high for light with strong photon-number fluctuations. Therefore, “noisy” light sources
are much more efficient for multiphoton effects than coherent sources with the same mean power, pulse
duration, and repetition rate. Here we generate optical harmonics of the order of 2–4 from a bright squeezed
vacuum, a state of light consisting of only quantum noise with no coherent component. We observe up to 2
orders of magnitude enhancement in the generation of optical harmonics due to ultrafast photon-number
fluctuations. This feature is especially important for the nonlinear optics of fragile structures, where the use of a noisy pump can considerably increase the effect without overcoming the damage threshold.},
