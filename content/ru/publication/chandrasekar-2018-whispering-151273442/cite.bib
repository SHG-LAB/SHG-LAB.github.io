 abstract = {Organic microstructures attract much attention due to their exciting properties that
can be introduced by a proper choice of the composition, shape and alignment in an array. Here
we apply the nonlinear optical microscopy for the studies of resonant properties of individual
response of organic microspheres of various compositions. The observed spectral modulation
of the two-photon luminescence spectra of such structures is caused by excitation of the
whispering gallery modes (WGMs) that correspond to the two-photon luminescence spectrum
of a particular microparticle specimen. Lasing and photobleaching effects induced by intense
near-IR laser radiation are discussed.},
