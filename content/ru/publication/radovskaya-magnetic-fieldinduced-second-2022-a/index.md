abstract: We report on the experimental investigations of the optical second harmonic
  generation and magnetooptical effects at the second-harmonic frequency in thin films
  consisting of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials and including exchange-coupled
  layers, one of which is pinned with an antiferromagnetic layer. The exchange coupling
  manifests itself in such structures as a shift of the hysteresis loops relative
  to the zero magnetic field under the linear magnetooptical Kerr effect. We show
  that this effect appears to a much less extent in the nonlinear magnetooptical Kerr
  effect at the second harmonic response. The magnetic field dependences of the second
  harmonic intensity contain a single magnetic hysteresis loop slightly shifted relative
  to the zero magnetic field and this shift increases with a decrease in the laser
  pumping radiation power.
