abstract: 'Recently the spatial and temporal splitting of short laser pulses passing
  through the one-dimensional photonic crystal (PC) at Laue geometry was theoretically
  predicted on the basis of dynamical diffraction theory for X-ray optics Bragg diffraction.
  This prediction promises the generation of pairs of pulses with separately tunable
  parameters and delay (which can be used in pump-probe technique) and the periodic
  variation of the diffracted beams intensity – pendellösung effect (which allows
  some kinds of optical switching). We present the experimental and numerical studies
  of the laser pulse propagation in 1d PC at Laue geometry. The diffraction patterns
  and the multiperiodic pendellösung effect were obtained experimentally. All effects
  including temporal pulse splitting were simulated numerically using the FDTD method
  for ideal and defect PCs. '
