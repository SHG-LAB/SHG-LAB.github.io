abstract: Highly anisotropic metal-dielectric structures reveal unique dispersion
  properties providing new optical effects. Here we study experimentally linear optical
  and magneto-optical response of arrays of plasmonic gold nanorods and similar structures
  complemented by a thin nickel film. We show that both types of structures reveal
  distinct optical features expected for hyperbolic media and associated with the
  epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) and epsilon-near-pole (ENP) points. In the case of Ni-containing
  nanocomposites, we observe linear magneto-optical effects in transmission through
  the structure, increasing in the vicinity of these points. This observation reveals
  an important role of the local field enhancement in a hyperbolic medium associated
  with ENZ and ENP dispersion points in the appearance of magneto-optical activity
  of magnetic hyperbolic metamaterials.
