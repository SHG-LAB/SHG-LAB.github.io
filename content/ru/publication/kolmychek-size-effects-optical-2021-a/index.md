abstract: Search for new types of efficient magnetoplasmonic structures that combine
  high transparency with strong magneto-optical (MO) activity is an actual problem.
  Here, we demonstrate that composite heterostructures based on thin perfectly-arranged
  opal films and a perforated cobalt nanolayer meet these requirements. Anomalous
  transmission appears due to periodic perforation of Co consistent with the regular
  set of voids between opal spheres, while resonantly enhanced MO response involves
  the effects of surface plasmon-polariton (SPP) excitation at opal/Co interface or
  those associated with photonic band gap (PBG) in opal photonic crystals. We observed
  the enhancement of the MO effect of up to 0.6% in the spectral vicinity of the SPP
  excitation, and several times less strong effect close to the PBG, while the combined
  appearance of PBG and SPP decreases the resultant MO response. Observed resonant
  magneto-optical properties of opal/Co heterostructures show that they can be treated
  as functional self-assembled magnetoplasmonic crystals with resonantly enhanced
  and controllable MO effect.
