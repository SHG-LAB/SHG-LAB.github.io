 abstract = {Search for new types of efficient magnetoplasmonic structures that combine high transparency with strong magneto-optical (MO) activity is an actual problem. Here, we demonstrate that composite heterostructures based on thin perfectly-arranged opal films and a perforated cobalt nanolayer meet these requirements. Anomalous transmission appears due to periodic perforation of Co consistent with the regular set of voids between opal spheres, while resonantly enhanced MO response involves the effects of surface plasmon-polariton (SPP) excitation at opal/Co interface or those associated with photonic band gap (PBG) in opal photonic crystals. We observed the enhancement of the MO effect of up to 0.6% in the spectral vicinity of the SPP excitation, and several times less strong effect close to the PBG, while the combined appearance of PBG and SPP decreases the resultant MO response. Observed resonant magneto-optical properties of opal/Co heterostructures show that they can be treated as functional self-assembled magnetoplasmonic crystals with resonantly enhanced and controllable MO effect.},
