abstract: Magneto-optical effects in metalâ€“dielectric nanostructured materials based
  on opal films coated with a thin cobalt/silver nanolayer, whose surface has a close-packed
  hexagonal lattice of metal nanohemispheres and nanoholes, have been investigated.
  It has been demonstrated experimentally and theoretically that a wide spectrum of
  modes of propagating surface plasmon polaritons is excited in such a system, which
  leads to a resonant enhancement of the magneto-optical effect in the Voigt geometry.
