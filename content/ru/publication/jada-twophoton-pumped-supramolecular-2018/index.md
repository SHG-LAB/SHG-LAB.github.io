abstract: Abstract A two‐photon pumped non‐linear optical (NLO) Fabry‐Pèrot (F‐P)
  type organic micro‐crystal resonator useful for a myriad of upconversion‐based light
  technologies is presented. The resonator is parallelepiped‐shaped and composed of
  a self‐assembled donor‐acceptor‐donor type molecule namely, 9,9,9”,9”‐tetramethyl‐9H,9’H,9”H‐[2, 2’:7,2”‐terfluoren]‐9’‐one
  (TTO). X‐ray crystal structure of an orange‐yellow TTO micro‐crystal reveals C−H⋅⋅⋅O
  type weak intermolecular hydrogen bond between the oxygen atom of the fluorenone
  unit and fluorine hydrogen atom. For one‐ and two‐photon excitation the micro‐crystals
  exhibit F‐P type modes in their photoluminescence signal. The fundamental frequency‐dependent
  NLO intensity shows a continuous increase as the fundamental wavelength is decreasing
  down to 770 nm. The two‐photon luminescence signals from these micro‐resonators
  are several orders of magnitude higher than the thin films of similar thickness.
