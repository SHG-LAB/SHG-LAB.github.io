 abstract = {Recently the spatial and temporal splitting of short laser pulses passing through the one-dimensional photonic crystal (PC) at Laue geometry was theoretically predicted on the basis of dynamical diffraction theory for X-ray optics Bragg diffraction. This prediction promises the generation of pairs of pulses with separately tunable parameters and delay (which can be used in pump-probe technique) and the periodic variation of the diffracted beams intensity -- pendellösung effect (which allows some kinds of optical switching). We present the experimental and numerical studies of the laser pulse propagation in 1d PC at Laue geometry. The diffraction patterns and the multiperiodic pendellösung effect were obtained experimentally. All effects including temporal pulse splitting were simulated numerically using the FDTD method for ideal and defect PCs.},
