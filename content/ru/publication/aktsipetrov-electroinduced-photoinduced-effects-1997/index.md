abstract: The mechanism of optical second-harmonic generation (SHG) in thin solid
  oriented and nonoriented films of bacteriorhodopsin (bR) is studied. The role of
  the random spatial inhomogeneity of the quadratic susceptibility in the mechanism
  of diffuse and depolarized SHG in thin solid bR films is discussed. A hyper-Rayleigh
  scattering formalism is used for the description of SHG in these films. Electroinduced
  and photoinduced effects in SHG are detected, and the saturated concentrations of
  the electroinduced and the photoinduced spectral forms of this type of bR film are
  estimated. Nondestructive SHG readout of bR-based optical memories is suggested.
