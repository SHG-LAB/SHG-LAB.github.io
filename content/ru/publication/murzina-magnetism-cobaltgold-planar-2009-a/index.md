abstract: The structural and magnetic properties of a cobalt nanolayer placed between
  a silicon substrate and a protective gold layer are studied. At a cobalt layer mass
  thickness of 1-2 nm, a nanoisland structure is shown to form. This thickness range
  is characterized by a local maximum of the magnetooptical Kerr effect and enhanced
  nonlinear optical and magnetic nonlinear optical responses at the second-harmonic
  frequency. This enhancement can be caused by the excitation of local surface plasmons
  and an increase in the local fields at the probing-radiation and second-harmonic
  frequencies in metallic nanoislands. The surface-sensitive nonlinear magnetooptical
  Kerr effect at the second-harmonic frequency is maximal at a cobalt layer thickness
  of about 2 nm, which corresponds to the characteristic scale of magnetization formation
  in the near-surface layer in cobalt.
