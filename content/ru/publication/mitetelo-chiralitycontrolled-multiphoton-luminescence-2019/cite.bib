 abstract = {Production of chiral light and its manipulation down to nanolevel is a very challenging endeavor in the area of nanophotonics. In this work, the above demanding requirements are realized explicitly in two R‐ and S‐type chiral organic optical waveguides which are self‐assembled from charge‐transfer type axially chiral enantiomeric molecules. These enantiomerically pure micro‐optical waveguides generate one‐, two‐, three‐photon pumped optical emissions. Remarkably, these waveguides also demonstrate pronounced circular dichroism effects in the nonlinear optical (NLO) emission which is very useful to produce molecular chirality information encoded NLO photonic structures.},
