abstract: Production of chiral light and its manipulation down to nanolevel is a very
  challenging endeavor in the area of nanophotonics. In this work, the above demanding
  requirements are realized explicitly in two R‐ and S‐type chiral organic optical
  waveguides which are self‐assembled from charge‐transfer type axially chiral enantiomeric
  molecules. These enantiomerically pure micro‐optical waveguides generate one‐, two‐,
  three‐photon pumped optical emissions. Remarkably, these waveguides also demonstrate
  pronounced circular dichroism effects in the nonlinear optical (NLO) emission which
  is very useful to produce molecular chirality information encoded NLO photonic structures.
