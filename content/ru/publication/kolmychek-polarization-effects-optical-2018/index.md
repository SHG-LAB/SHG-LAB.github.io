abstract: The main experimental results that have been recently obtained for the linear
  and nonlinear opticalresponses of ordered two-dimensional arrays of planar chiral
  metallic nanostructures are considered. Theseexperimental results demonstrate that
  the polarization state of the linear and nonlinear optical responses ofmetasurfaces
  are substantially determined by the chirality of a single nanoelement and the related
  spatial dis-tribution of the optical second harmonic generation intensity. As a
  result, circular dichroism effects appear inthe linear and nonlinear optical responses
  of a chiral metasurface. The anisotropy of the second harmonic isexperimentally
  shown to play a substantial role in the effects of extrinsic chirality, which is
  determined by thespatial symmetry of an array of nanoelements. The main properties
  of circular dichroism in the quadraticoptical response are supported by numerical
  calculations and symmetry analysis of structures.
