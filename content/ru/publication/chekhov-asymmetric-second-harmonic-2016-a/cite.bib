 abstract = {Strong angular asymmetry of second harmonic generation (SHG) is observed in an anisotropic plasmonic crystal. The asymmetry is enhanced up to 95% by the surface plasmon polariton (SPP) excitation at the anisotropic interface. The SHG output is shown to be sensitive to the SPP propagation direction.},
