 abstract = {We demonstrate enhancement of second-harmonic generation efficiency in sub-wavelength resonant nanostructures supporting optically induced magnetic response. This is achieved through simultaneous excitation of electric and magnetic multipoles at the second-harmonic wavelength and their constructive interference.},
