 abstract = {We discuss photonic effects in arrays of frustum-shaped organic microstructures prepared from organic orange dye composed on a solid substrate by self-assembling technique. We demonstrate that such structures reveal strong amplification of second-order nonlinear optical response, including optical second harmonic generation (SHG) and two-photon fluorescence (TPF), as compared to that of a continuous film. This is associated with a strong light localization in microstructures composed of high refractive index material. The TPF and SHG power dependencies show that the observed effects are governed by high second-order nonlinearity of the dye damped by a strong absorption. FDTD calculations confirm that the mechanism of the light localization inside organic frustums can be in the form of whispering gallery modes excitation.},
