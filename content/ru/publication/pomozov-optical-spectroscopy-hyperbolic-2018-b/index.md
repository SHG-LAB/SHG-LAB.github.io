abstract: Linear and nonlinear optical spectroscopy of an array of Au nanorods, embedded
  in a dielectric matrix, is studied in the spectral range corresponding to specific
  dispersion points of such a structure. Experimental data is in a good agreement
  with the results of numerical modelling based on the effective medium model, as
  well as on linear and nonlinear FDTD simulations.
