 abstract = {Linear and nonlinear optical spectroscopy of an array of Au nanorods, embedded in a dielectric matrix, is studied in the spectral range corresponding to specific dispersion points of such a structure. Experimental data is in a good agreement with the results of numerical modelling based on the effective medium model, as well as on linear and nonlinear FDTD simulations.},
