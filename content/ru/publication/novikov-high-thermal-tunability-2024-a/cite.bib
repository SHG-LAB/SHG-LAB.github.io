 abstract = {We experimentally and numerically revealed a salient thermal effect in the transmission of the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) metamaterial consisting of an array of plasmonic nanorods in a dielectric template. The flavor of the structure is freestanding nanorod segments surrounded by nematic liquid crystals possessing a strong thermal dependence of the anisotropic refractive index. The observed resonant enhancement of the thermal sensitivity of the transmission of this ENZ structure results from its nonlocal optical response giving rise to the zero-transmission effect, control over which is at the heart of our approach.},
