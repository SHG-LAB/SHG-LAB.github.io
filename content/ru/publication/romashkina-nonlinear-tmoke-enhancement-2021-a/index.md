abstract: Resonant optical properties of the magnetoplasmonic crystals, which support
  propagation of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) accompanied by magnetooptical effects,
  have found success in magnetic field driven control of optical radiation. In this
  work we investigate the resonant magnetooptical effects in the second harmonic generation
  in the magnetoplasmonic crystal formed by gold/pemalloy bifilm covering dielectric
  grating. Strong transverse magnetooptical Kerr with the contrast up to 30% is revealed
  in the spectral vicinity of the SPP excitation.
