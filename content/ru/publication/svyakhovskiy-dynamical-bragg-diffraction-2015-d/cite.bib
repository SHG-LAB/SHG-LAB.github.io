 abstract = {We consider optical effects accompanying the dynamical Bragg diffraction in the Laue geometry in one-dimensional photonic crystals (PhC). We predict theoretically, and observe in the experiment, the diffraction-induced pulse splitting of femtosecond light pulse, the optical switching due to the optical pendular effect, and the effects of selective compression and focusing. These effects originate from the interaction of two spatial eigenmodes of the photonic crystal: Borrmann and anti-Borrmann, which are spatially localized within a PhC in the layers with low and high dielectric constants, respectively.},
