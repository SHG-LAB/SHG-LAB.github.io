abstract: Magnetization induced second harmonic generation (MSHG) is observed in Gd-containing
  Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films. The nonlinear optical studies reveal significant alterations
  in the second harmonic generation (SHG) intensity and in the polarization and phase
  of the second harmonic (SH) wave induced by application of DC magnetic field. The
  violation of polarization selection rules and the diffuseness of the MSHG intensity
  indicates the inhomogeneity of LB structure and the hyper-Rayleigh scattering mechanism
  of MSHG. The latter proofs the existence of 2D-islands of Gd ions in the structural
  unit of the LB films which is composed by monolayer of rare-earth ions compressed
  between two layers of stearic acid molecules.
