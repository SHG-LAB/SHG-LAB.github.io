 abstract = {Magnetization induced second harmonic generation (MSHG) is observed in Gd-containing Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films. The nonlinear optical studies reveal significant alterations in the second harmonic generation (SHG) intensity and in the polarization and phase of the second harmonic (SH) wave induced by application of DC magnetic field. The violation of polarization selection rules and the diffuseness of the MSHG intensity indicates the inhomogeneity of LB structure and the hyper-Rayleigh scattering mechanism of MSHG. The latter proofs the existence of 2D-islands of Gd ions in the structural unit of the LB films which is composed by monolayer of rare-earth ions compressed between two layers of stearic acid molecules.},
