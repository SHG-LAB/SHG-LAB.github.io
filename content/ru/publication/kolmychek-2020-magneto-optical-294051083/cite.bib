 abstract = {The results of the experimental studies and numerical simulation of optical and magneto-optical properties of composite structures containing gold nanorods in porous anodic alumina templates and coated by a continuous nickel film are presented. We reveal two features in the Faraday rotation spectra of the structures in the vicinity of the wavelengths of 540 nm and 810 nm, which correspond to the epsilon-near-pole and epsilon-near-zero regions, respectively. Experimentally observed distinct enhancement of magneto-optical effects in the structures in the spectral vicinity of these points are consistent with the simulation results and open up novel opportunities for magnetic-field-assisted light manipulation.},
