abstract: Optical green emitting microresonators with high values of nonlinearity
  are desired for high optical up-conversion energy storage and lasing applications.
  Here we report on the synthesis of benzylammonium lead iodide (BALI) perovskite
  microcrystals made via antisolvent diffusion method. The use of polystyrene (PS)
  matrix helps the growth of environmentally stable BALI nanocrystals as a result
  of polymer capping. Optimization of the ratio of BALI-PS during the self-assembly
  process leads to the formation of defect-free composite microspheres. Further, these
  BALI crystals act as an active material within the microsphere resonators that display
  whispering gallery modes (WGM). These WGMs are responsible for high optical storage
  energy of resonators evidenced by their Q-factor as high as ∼1180. Two-dimensional
  finite difference time-domain calculation shows the concentration of the electric
  field near the microspheres boundary within a small mode volume of 1.83 μm3. Remarkably,
  BALI-PS composite microresonators and their neat crystals exhibit brilliant two-photon
  luminescence upon excitation by the infrared fundamental radiation. This simplistic
  microresonators fabrication technique provides a route toward low-cost nonlinear
  optical microlasers and other optical energy devices useful for various applications.
