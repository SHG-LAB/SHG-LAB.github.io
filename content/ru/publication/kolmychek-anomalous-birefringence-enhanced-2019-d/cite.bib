 abstract = {Hyperbolic metamaterials based on the ordered arrays of metal nanorods in a dielectric media are of great interest owing to new optical effects appearing in such artificial media. Here we study the effects in the polarization state of light passing through a nanocomposite material consisting of Au nanorods in porous alumina and a similar structure supplemented by a nanolayer of ferromagnetic nickel. We demonstrate that close to the epsilon-near-zero dispersion point, under the transition to the hyperbolic dispersion region, the nanocomposites reveal anomalously high modulation of the polarization state of light, which appears as polarization plane rotation and ellipticity changes of probing radiation with a zero ellipticity. This effect is applied for the giant enhancement of the Faraday effect in a continuous ferromagnetic film staying in contact with hyperbolic material. These findings open a path for the design of polarization state control by using hyperbolic metamaterials.},
