abstract: Nonlinear-optical effects in magnetic composite nanostructures are of fundamental
  and practical interest. Here we study, on the micro- and macro-scales, the nonlinear-optical
  and magnetooptical response of metasurfaces made of arrays of magnetic Co/Au plasmonic
  particles on the crystalline garnet layer. We find a manyfold enhancement of the
  efficiency of the optical second harmonic generation as well as a strong modification
  of the magnetooptical response of this metasurface as compared to the pure garnet
  film. Numerical modelling of the local electromagnetic field confirms these findings.
