 abstract = {We study the light transmission through absorbing one-dimensional photonic crystals in the Laue diffraction scheme. The considered structure is designed to demonstrate topological phase transition associated with the changing of the symmetry of the eigenmodes of the electromagnetic field. We show that photonic crystal demonstrates enhanced transmission and pronounced features of the frequency-angle transmission spectrum associated with the band inversion.},
