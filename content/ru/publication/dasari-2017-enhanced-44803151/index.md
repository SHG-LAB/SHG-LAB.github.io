abstract: We discuss photonic effects in arrays of frustum-shaped organic microstructures
  prepared from organic orange dye composed on a solid substrate by self-assembling
  technique. We demonstrate that such structures reveal strong amplification of second-order
  nonlinear optical response, including optical second harmonic generation (SHG) and
  two-photon fluorescence (TPF), as compared to that of a continuous film. This is
  associated with a strong light localization in microstructures composed of high
  refractive index material. The TPF and SHG power dependencies show that the observed
  effects are governed by high second-order nonlinearity of the dye damped by a strong
  absorption. FDTD calculations confirm that the mechanism of the light localization
  inside organic frustums can be in the form of whispering gallery modes excitation.
