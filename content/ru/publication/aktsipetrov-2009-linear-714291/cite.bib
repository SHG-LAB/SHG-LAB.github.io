 annote = {Linear and nonlinear magnetooptics are applied to study the magnetic properties of Au/Co/Si planar nanostructures. The dependence of the nonlinear magneto-optical Kerr effect on the thickness of the cobalt layer, d(Co), reaches a maximum at d(Co) approximate to 2 nm. This characteristic thickness is consistent with the formation of surface magnetization. An enhancement of the second harmonic generation (SHG) intensity and of magnetization-induced SHG is attained for an island-like structure of the cobalt layer, and is associated with the excitation of localized surface plasmons in cobalt nanoislands.
