abstract: Magnetic materials where at least one dimension is in the nanometer scale
  typically exhibit different magnetic, magnetotransport, and magnetooptical properties
  compared to bulk materials. Composite magnetic thin films where the matrix composition,
  magnetic cluster size, and overall composite film thickness can be experimentally
  tailored via adequate processing or growth parameters offer a viable nanoscale platform
  to investigate possible correlations between nonlinear magnetooptical and magnetotransport
  properties, since both types of properties are sensitive to the local magnetization
  landscape. It has been shown that the local magnetization contrast affects the nonlinear
  magnetooptical properties as well as the magnetotransport properties in magneticmetal/nonmagnetic
  metal multilayers; thus, nanocomposite films showcase another path to investigate
  possible correlations between these distinct properties which may prove useful for
  sensing applications.
