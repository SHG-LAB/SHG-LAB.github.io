abstract: We propose non-phase-matched sum frequency generation (SFG) as a method
  for characterizing broadband multimode light. Both the central wavelength and the
  bandwidth are in this case not limited by the phase matching condition. As an example,
  we consider bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) generated through high-gain parametric
  down conversion (PDC). In the spectrum of SFG from BSV, we observe the coherent
  peak and the incoherent background. We show that the ratio of their widths is equal
  to the number of frequency modes in BSV, which in the case of low-gain PDC gives
  the degree of frequency entanglement for photon pairs. By generating the sum frequency
  in the near-surface region of a nonlinear crystal, we increase the SFG efficiency
  and get rid of the modulation caused by chromatic dispersion, known as Maker fringes.
  This allows one to use non-phasematched SFG as a wavelength-independent autocorrelator.
  Furthermore, we demonstrate efficient non-phase-matched three- and four-frequency
  summation of broadband multimode light, hardly possible under phase matching. We
  show that the latter contains the coherent peak while the former does not.
