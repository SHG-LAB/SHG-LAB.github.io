abstract: Ferroelectric properties of thin (1.5-4 mum planar cells of a ferroelectric
  liquid crystal (FLC) mixture are studied using electro-optic measurements, second-harmonic
  generation (SHG) and SHG interferometry. A switching behaviour of the FLC cells
  in external dc electric fields is observed. It is characterised by rotation of the
  polarisation plane of the transmitted light and by changes in the SHG intensity,
  phase and anisotropy dependences, which are attributed to a collective motion of
  the system as a ferroelectric uniform state with C-2 symmetry.
