abstract: Optical second harmonic generation (SHG) is studied from multilayer graphene
  films in the presence of dc electric current flowing in the sample plane. Graphene
  layers are manufactured by the chemical vapor deposition technique and deposited
  on an oxidized Si(001) substrate. SHG intensity from the graphene layer is found
  to be negligible in the absence of the dc current, while it increases dramatically
  with the application of the electric current. The current-induced change of the
  SHG intensity from graphene/SiO2/Si(001) rises linearly with the current amplitude
  and changes its sign under the reversal of the current direction to the opposite.
  The observed effect is explained in terms of the interference of second harmonic
  radiation reflected from the Si surface and that induced by the dc current in multilayer
  graphene.
