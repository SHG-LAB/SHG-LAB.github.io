abstract: 'Nonlinear microresonators are very desired for a wide variety of applications.
  Up-conversion processes responsible for the transformation of IR laser radiation
  into visible are intensity-dependent and thus rather sensitive to all involved effects,
  which can mask each other. In this work we study the phenomena that are the most
  important for possible lasing in 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-(4-dimethylaminostyryl)-4
  H-pyran dye spherical microresonators: the two-photon absorption and photobleaching.
  Based on the suggested model of the threshold-like dependence of the two-photon
  luminescence (TPL) on pump power, we demonstrate the role of intensity-dependent
  photobleaching in the appearance of the TPL and find a good agreement with the experiment.
  This finding is important for the analysis of lasing in nonlinear dye-based resonators.'
