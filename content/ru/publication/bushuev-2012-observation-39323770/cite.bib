 annote = {We have observed a novel optical effect specific for multilayer porous silicon-based photonic crystals (PC), namely the Bragg diffraction-induced laser pulse splitting into two ones propagating with different group velocities within the PC. In a homogenous medium at the PC output each pulse is spatially separated into two pulses, propagating in the transmission and diffraction directions.},
