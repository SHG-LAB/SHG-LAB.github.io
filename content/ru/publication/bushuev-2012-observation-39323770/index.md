abstract: We have observed a novel optical effect specific for multilayer porous silicon-based
  photonic crystals (PC), namely the Bragg diffraction-induced laser pulse splitting
  into two ones propagating with different group velocities within the PC. In a homogenous
  medium at the PC output each pulse is spatially separated into two pulses, propagating
  in the transmission and diffraction directions.
