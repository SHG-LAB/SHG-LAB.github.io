abstract: Recent studies of optical, magneto-optical, and nonlinear optical effects
  in hyperbolic metamaterials based on metal nanorods in a dielectric template are
  reviewed. An increase in the efficiency of the optical second harmonic generation
  in the spectral vicinity of zero effective permittivity (epsilon near zero) of hyperbolic
  metamaterials, as well as a jump of the phase of a quadratic nonlinear optical signal,
  is detected at the transition between elliptic and hyperbolic dispersion regimes.
  The resonant enhancement of magneto-optical effects in composite magnetic hyperbolic
  metamaterials in the spectral vicinity of nearly zero effective permittivity is
  demonstrated. Effects of fast and slow light in the interaction of ultrashort laser
  pulses with hyperbolic metamaterials are experimentally revealed.
