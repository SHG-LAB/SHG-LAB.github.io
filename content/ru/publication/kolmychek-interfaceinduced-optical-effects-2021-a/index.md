abstract: Multilayer planar nanostructures formed by ferromagnetic and heavy metals
  can reveal unique properties governed by their composition and geometry. The main
  role in their formation belongs to the interfacial spinâ€“orbit interaction leading
  to specific magnetic distributions and behavior at the nanoscale. Here we present
  a complex analysis of magneto-optical effects in nanolayered films composed of different
  combinations of cobalt nanolayers with tantalum and platinum ones. Magnetic force
  microscopy studies confirm inhomogeneous magnetization distribution in films, which
  can be described in terms of magnetic ripple domain or chiral structures. Experiments
  on the Brillouin light scattering directly confirm the appearance of the interface
  Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in the studied films, the effect increases with
  the structural asymmetry. Finally, interface-sensitive second harmonic generation
  (SHG) reveals odd in magnetic field SHG intensity effect for the longitudinal geometry
  of the applied dc magnetic field that is absent for homogeneously magnetized structures.
