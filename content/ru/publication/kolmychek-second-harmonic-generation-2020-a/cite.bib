 abstract = {Specific features of optical second harmonic (SH) generation in arrays of chiral helical nanoholesin a silver film are studied experimentally. An increase in the intensity of the second-order nonlinear optical response is observed in the region of anomalous resonant transmission. The significant role of the rotational symmetry of the array of nanoholes in the formation of the SH response is revealed, which determines the azimuthal dependence of both the intensity of the second-order optical signal and the SH circular dichroism.},
