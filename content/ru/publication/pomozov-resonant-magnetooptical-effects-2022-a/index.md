abstract: New approaches for the composition of efficient robust plasmonic crystals
  are very desired for practical applications as well as for the observation of new
  exciting effects at the nanoscale. Herein, both experimentally and theoretically
  resonant optical effects in encapsulated magnetoplasmonic crystals composed of a
  1D gold grating sandwiched between two layers of iron garnet with slightly different
  dielectric properties are studied. It is demonstrated that depending on the geometry
  of the magnetic field application, various mechanisms provide resonant enhancement
  of the magnetooptical (MO) response of the structure; the strongest MO effect is
  attained for the case of waveguide modes propagating in iron garnet dielectric layer
  along the longitudinal magnetic field, when the magnetization-induced rotation of
  the polarization plane up to a few degrees is observed. The obtained results demonstrate
  high potential of magnetoplasmonic waveguides as stable and efficient plasmonic
  devices.
