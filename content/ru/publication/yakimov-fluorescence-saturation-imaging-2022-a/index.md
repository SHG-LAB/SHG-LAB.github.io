abstract: Imaging of molecular-specific photophysical parameterssuch as fluorescence
  intensity, emission band shape, or fluorescence decay is widely used in biophysics.
  Here we proposea method for quantitative mapping of another molecularspecific parameter
  in living cells, two-photon absorptioncross section, based on the fluorescence saturation
  effect.Using model dye solutions and cell culture, we show thatthe analysis of the
  fluorescence signal dependencies on theintensity of two-photon excitation within
  the range typicalfor routine two-photon microscopy experiments allows one toreconstruct
  two-photon absorption cross section maps acrossthe sample. We believe that the absorption
  cross sectioncontrast visualized by the proposed fluorescence saturationimaging
  microscopy could be a new tool for studying processes in living cells and tissues.
