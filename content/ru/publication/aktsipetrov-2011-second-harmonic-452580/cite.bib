 abstract = {Layered structures based on porous silicon have been studied by confocal microscopy of the second optical harmonic. A linear increase in the second-harmonic intensity with increasing porosity of the layers has been observed. This behavior may result from spatial fluctuations in the dipole quadratic response of the pore walls.},
