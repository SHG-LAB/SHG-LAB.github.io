abstract: Control over the magnetic domain structure of garnet films is an important
  task thatis attractive for a wide range of applications. One of the possible approaches
  here is based on the introduction of additional structured magnetic coverages interacting
  with the garnet layer. Inthis study, we demonstrate that arrays of asymmetric ferromagnetic
  cobalt particles regularly arranged on the surface of Lu,Bi-substituted iron garnet
  film influence the orientation and width of the stripe domains, as stems from the
  optical microscopy, magneto-optical and diffraction studies. We also show that triangular-shaped
  Co particles induce the asymmetry of the magnetic field dependence on the magneto-optical
  Kerr effect of the composite structure. We assert that the key effect here is the
  interaction of the residual magnetic moments of Co particles with thesurface closure
  domains.
