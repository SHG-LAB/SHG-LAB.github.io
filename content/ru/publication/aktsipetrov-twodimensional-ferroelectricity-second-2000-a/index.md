abstract: 'Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectricity and 2D ferroelectric-paraelectric
  phase transitions are experimentally studied, for the first time, by means of optical
  second harmonic generation (SHG) in ultrathin Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of vinylidene
  fluoride with trifluoroethylene. The temperature dependence of the SHG intensity
  confirms the existence of two types of 2D ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition:
  the first one in the topmost layer of LB films and the other, almost thickness independent,
  in the bulk of ferroelectric LB films. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights
