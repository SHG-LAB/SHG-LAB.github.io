 abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectricity and 2D ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transitions are experimentally studied, for the first time, by means of optical second harmonic generation (SHG) in ultrathin Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of vinylidene fluoride with trifluoroethylene. The temperature dependence of the SHG intensity confirms the existence of two types of 2D ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition: the first one in the topmost layer of LB films and the other, almost thickness independent, in the bulk of ferroelectric LB films.
