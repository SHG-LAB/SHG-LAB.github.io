abstract: Phase transitions and switching behaviour in thin (1.5 - 4 mum) planar cells
  of a ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) mixture are studied by optical second harmonic
  generation (SHG). A pronounced anisotropy of the SHG response shows a high ordering
  degree of the FLC molecules in the cells. We studied the electric field-induced
  switching of the FLC cells and their temperature dependence by means of SHG. This
  shows the existence of a 10-20 nm thick frozen sub-surface layer of FLC molecules,which
  cannot be switched by an electric field well above the bulk saturating field and
  at significantly high temperatures.
