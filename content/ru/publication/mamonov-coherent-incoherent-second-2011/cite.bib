 abstract = {Azimuthal anisotropy of Stokes parameters of the second harmonic generation ( SHG) generated and observed in reflection from a periodic planar area of G-shaped gold nanostructures is studied. A strong anisotropy of both coherent and incoherent SHG components is observed. Finite-difference time-domain calculations prove that the observed effects are due to the anisotropic enhancement of the fundamental radiation within the G-shaped structures.
