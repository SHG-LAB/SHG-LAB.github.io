abstract: Recent technological achievements provide unique possibilities for the composition
  of arrays of nanostructures with desired properties, nowadays referred to as metamaterials,
  that are perspective for various applications. A special place here belongs to chiral
  nanostructures that could compete with the natural materials both in efficiency
  and size of functional elements. For the case of metamaterials, optical activity
  originates from a special shape of the elements and their arrangement within an
  array. This research field has been actively developing over the last years and
  significant values of chirality effects were observed in the linear-optical response
  of metallic nanostructures [1]. Furthermore, chirality effects are more pronounced
  in the nonlinear-optical response of such structures [2,3], the latter being governed
  to a great extent by the local field distribution inside the metal nanostructures.
  In this talk we will focus mostly on the recent results on the linear and nonlinear
  optical effects in planar arrays of chiral nanostructures with the shape of a flat
  spiral (G-shaped nanostructures).
