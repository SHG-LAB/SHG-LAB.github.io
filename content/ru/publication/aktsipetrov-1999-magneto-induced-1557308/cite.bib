 abstract = {In this paper, we survey our previous and recent results of magneto-induced effects in second harmonic generation (SHG) from magnetic nanostructures. The degree of such effects is governed by the fine structure parameter and subsequently small in low order susceptibilities, yet enhanced at higher orders. One mechanism responsible for the enhancement of magneto-induced contributions to the SHG intensity is related to optical interference in the far-field region of the second harmonic fields generated by nonmagnetic and magneto-induced nonlinear polarizations. An interference model is considered for resonant and nonresonant, centrosymmetric and noncentrosymmetric media and is used to interpret the magneto-induced SHG results of Co nanocrystals and Gd monolayers.},
