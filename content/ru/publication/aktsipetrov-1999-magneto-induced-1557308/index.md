abstract: In this paper, we survey our previous and recent results of magneto-induced
  effects in second harmonic generation (SHG) from magnetic nanostructures. The degree
  of such effects is governed by the fine structure parameter and subsequently small
  in low order susceptibilities, yet enhanced at higher orders. One mechanism responsible
  for the enhancement of magneto-induced contributions to the SHG intensity is related
  to optical interference in the far-field region of the second harmonic fields generated
  by nonmagnetic and magneto-induced nonlinear polarizations. An interference model
  is considered for resonant and nonresonant, centrosymmetric and noncentrosymmetric
  media and is used to interpret the magneto-induced SHG results of Co nanocrystals
  and Gd monolayers.
