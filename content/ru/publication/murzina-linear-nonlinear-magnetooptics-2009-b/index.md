abstract: Linear and nonlinear magnetooptics are applied to study the magnetic properties
  of Au/Co/Si planar nanostructures. The dependence of the nonlinear magneto-optical
  Kerr effect on the thickness of the cobalt layer, d(Co), reaches a maximum at d(Co)
  approximate to 2 nm. This characteristic thickness is consistent with the formation
  of surface magnetization. An enhancement of the second harmonic generation (SHG)
  intensity and of magnetization-induced SHG is attained for an island-like structure
  of the cobalt layer, and is associated with the excitation of localized surface
  plasmons in cobalt nanoislands. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
