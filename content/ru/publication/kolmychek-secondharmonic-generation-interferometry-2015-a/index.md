abstract: We present the experimental studies on optical second-harmonic generation
  from nanostructures exhibiting magnetic dipole resonances in the visible spectral
  range. ``Nanosandwiches'' of the composition Au/MgF2/Au with the average disk diameter
  of 140 nm are packed in a square lattice with the period of 400 nm. We show that
  at normal incidence, the intensity of the second-harmonic (SH) wave generated by
  the array of nanostructures increases by an order of magnitude as the excitation
  wavelength approaches the magnetic-dipole resonance, while the phase of the SH wave
  experiences a shift up to 330i̧rc. Based on the phenomenological description of
  the SH process, the observed effects indicate the dominant role of the nonlinear
  magnetic-dipole polarization driven by the ̂emm susceptibility in SH generation
  in ``nanosandwiches.''
