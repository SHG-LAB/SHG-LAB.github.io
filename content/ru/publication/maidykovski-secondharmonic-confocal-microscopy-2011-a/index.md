abstract: Layered structures based on porous silicon have been studied by confocal
  microscopy of the second optical harmonic. A linear increase in the second-harmonic
  intensity with increasing porosity of the layers has been observed. This behavior
  may result from spatial fluctuations in the dipole quadratic response of the pore
  walls.
