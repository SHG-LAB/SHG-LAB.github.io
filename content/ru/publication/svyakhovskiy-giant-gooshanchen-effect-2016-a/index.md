abstract: We present the theoretical and experimental studies of the giant Goos-Hanchen
  effect and the effect of focusing of light beam in one-dimensional photonic crystals
  with spatial modulation of photonic band gap position. We show that the photonic
  crystal with slow exponentially modulated band gap applies the second-order phase
  modulation to the reflected light and can focus or defocus the light beam.
