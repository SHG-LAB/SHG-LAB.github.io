abstract: 'We have envisioned the preparation of an organic NLO surface, i.e., a film
  of frustum-shaped optical resonators self-assembled from an orange-red emitting,
  NLO molecule to concurrently generate enhanced TPL and/or SHG lasing emis-sions.
  In brief we present: (i) synthesis of a new red emitting A (dicyano)--D (amino)
  type non-centrosymmetric molecule with a $π$-bridge (stilbene-like) and its crystal
  structure (1), (ii) its self-assembly on a glass surface forming a thin film of
  frustum-shaped optical microresonators, (iii) single-particle WGM resonance PL spectra
  of microresonators and numerical simula-tions depicting the field localization inside
  these resonators due to WGM resonances, and (iv) production of both random lasing
  TPL and SHG from the organic NLO surface covered with frustum microresonators.'
