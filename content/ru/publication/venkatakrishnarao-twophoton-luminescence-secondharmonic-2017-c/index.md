abstract: 'We have envisioned the preparation of an organic NLO surface, i.e., a ﬁlm
  of frustum-shaped optical resonators self-assembled from an orange-red emitting,
  NLO molecule to concurrently generate enhanced TPL and/or SHG lasing emis-sions.
  In brief we present: (i) synthesis of a new red emitting A (dicyano)–D (amino) type
  non-centrosymmetric molecule with a π-bridge (stilbene-like) and its crystal structure
  (1), (ii) its self-assembly on a glass surface forming a thin ﬁlm of frustum-shaped
  optical microresonators, (iii) single-particle WGM resonance PL spectra of microresonators
  and numerical simula-tions depicting the ﬁeld localization inside these resonators
  due to WGM resonances, and (iv) production of both random lasing TPL and SHG from
  the organic NLO surface covered with frustum microresonators.'
