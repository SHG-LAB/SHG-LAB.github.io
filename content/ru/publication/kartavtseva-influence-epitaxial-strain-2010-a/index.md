abstract: Strained epitaxial BiFeO3 films deposited on (001) SrTiO3 substrates by
  metal organic chemical vapor deposition were studied by optical second harmonic
  generation (SHG) and SQUID magnetometry. The observed SHG intensity vs temperature
  dependencies indicate that for less strained films (sigmatextless0.6 GPa) a strong
  interplay between the ferroelectric and magnetic subsystems exists, while for the
  films with larger sigma-values strain-induced destruction of the magnetic cycloidal
  ordering takes place. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
