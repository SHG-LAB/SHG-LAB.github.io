 abstract = {Experimental and numerical studies of fast and slow light effects under the propagation of chirped femtosecond laser pulses in epsilon-near-zero metamaterials based on the array of metal nanorods are carried out. We show that the chirp brings about additional control over the fast and slow light regimes.},
