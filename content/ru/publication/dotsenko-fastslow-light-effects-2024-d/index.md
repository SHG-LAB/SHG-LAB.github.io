abstract: Experimental and numerical studies of fast and slow light effects under
  the propagation of chirped femtosecond laser pulses in epsilon-near-zero metamaterials
  based on the array of metal nanorods are carried out. We show that the chirp brings
  about additional control over the fast and slow light regimes.
