 abstract = {We reveal theoretically the effects of fast and slow light in transmission of femtosecond laser pulses through a silver nanorod-based hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM) and demonstrate the decisive role of optical nonlocality of HMMs in the appearance of these phenomena in the spectral vicinity of the epsilon-near-zero regime of HMM. Results sustain our recent experimental investigations of these effects.},
