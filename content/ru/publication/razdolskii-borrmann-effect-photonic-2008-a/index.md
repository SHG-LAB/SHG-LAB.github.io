abstract: Nonlinear-optical manifestations of the Borrmann effect that are consequences
  of the spectral dependence of the spatial distributions of the electromagnetic field
  in a structure are observed in one-dimensional photonic crystals. The spectrum of
  the light self-focusing effect corresponding to the propagation-matrix calculations
  has been measured near the edge of the photonic gap.
