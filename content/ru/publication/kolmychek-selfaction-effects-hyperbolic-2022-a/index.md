abstract: Intensive studies of hyperbolic metamaterials (HMMs) are induced by unique
  optical properties of this type of artificial media associated with their hyperbolic
  dispersion. Special attention is attracted to the nonlinear optical response of
  HMMs, which reveals anomalous behavior in definite spectral regions. Third-order
  nonlinear optical self-action effects that are perspective for applications were
  analyzed numerically, whereas such experiments have not been performed up to now.
  In this work we study experimentally the effects of the nonlinear absorption and
  refraction in ordered arrays of gold nanorods in porous aluminum oxide. We demonstrate
  strong enhancement and sign reversal of these effects in the vicinity of the epsilon-near-zero
  spectral point due to the resonant light localization and transition from elliptical
  to hyperbolic dispersion regimes.
