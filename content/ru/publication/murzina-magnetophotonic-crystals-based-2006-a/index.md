abstract: 'Three-dimensional magnetophotonic crystals (MPCs) based on artificial opals
  infiltrated by yttrium iron garnet (YIG) are fabricated and their structural, optical,
  and nonlinear optical properties are studied. The formation of the crystalline YIG
  inside the opal matrix is checked by x-ray analysis. Two templates are used for
  the infiltration by YIG: bare opals and those covered by a thin platinum film. Optical
  second-harmonic generation (SHG) technique is used to study the magnetization-induced
  nonlinear-optical properties of the composed MPCs. A high nonlinear magneto-optical
  Kerr effect in the SHG intensity is observed at the edge of the photonic band gap
  of the MPCs.'
