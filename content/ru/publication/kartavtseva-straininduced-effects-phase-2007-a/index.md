abstract: Optical second-harmonic generation (SHG) was applied to study the ferroelectric
  and magnetic properties of strained epitaxial BiFeO, films deposited on (001) SrTiO3
  substrates by metal organic chemical vapor deposition. A strong interplay between
  the ferroelectric and magnetic subsystems of bismuth ferrite films results in the
  pronounced temperature dependence of the SHG intensity. The decrease of the critical
  temperature of the ferroelectric phase transition and the expansion of the nonlinear
  transient area near Neel temperature were observed for the strained BiFeO3 films.
