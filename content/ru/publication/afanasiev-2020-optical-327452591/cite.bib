 abstract = {Properties of one-dimensional spatially periodic metal structures formed by a dielectric lattice covered by gold and permalloy films are studied by optical and magnetooptical spectroscopy techniques. It is shown that these structures reveal the excitation of surface plasmon-polaritons, with the resonance frequency that can be controlled by the geometry of the experiment. The magnetooptical Kerr effect modulation, which is absent in the case of a nonprofiled gold/permalloy bifilm, is observed in the spectral vicinity of the plasmon resonance.},
