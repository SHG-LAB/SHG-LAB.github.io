abstract: CoxAg1-x and (CoFe)(x)(Ag2O3)(1-x) nanogranular films exhibiting giant magnetoresistance
  (GMR) are studied using optical second-harmonic generation (SHG) and nonlinear magneto-optical
  Kerr effect (NOMOKE). A noticeable SHG azimuthal anisotropy and a low level of the
  diffuse second-harmonic (SH) signal indicate a high degree of orientational ordering
  of magnetic granules in the film plane. Nonmonotonous dependences on x are observed
  for the intensity of specular and diffuse SH components and for the NOMOKE magnetic
  contrast. The latter attains a local maximum, for each film type, at the same value
  of x as GMR, which is considered as a manifestation of correlation between NOMOKE
  and GMR. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
