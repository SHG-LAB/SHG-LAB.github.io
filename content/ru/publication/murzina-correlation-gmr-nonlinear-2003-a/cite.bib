 abstract = {CoxAg1-x and (CoFe)(x)(Ag2O3)(1-x) nanogranular films exhibiting giant magnetoresistance (GMR) are studied using optical second-harmonic generation (SHG) and nonlinear magneto-optical Kerr effect (NOMOKE). A noticeable SHG azimuthal anisotropy and a low level of the diffuse second-harmonic (SH) signal indicate a high degree of orientational ordering of magnetic granules in the film plane. Nonmonotonous dependences on x are observed for the intensity of specular and diffuse SH components and for the NOMOKE magnetic contrast. The latter attains a local maximum, for each film type, at the same value of x as GMR, which is considered as a manifestation of correlation between NOMOKE and GMR. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.
