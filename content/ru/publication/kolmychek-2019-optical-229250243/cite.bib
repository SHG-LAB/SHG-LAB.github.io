 abstract = {We present the experimental results on optical an nonlinear-optical effects in hyperbolic media based on gold nanorods arrays in porous anodic alumina, demonstrating pronounced effects attributed to epsilon-near-zero and epsilon-near-pole dispersion points. In the spectral vicinity of the epsilon-near-zero, an enhancement of the optical activity and of the second harmonic intensity are observed.},
