abstract: The first results obtained in the synthesis of one-dimensional ferroelectric
  photonic crystals based on nanostructured lead zirconate titanate and porous silicon
  are reported. The samples synthesized are studied using linear reflection and second
  optical harmonic spectroscopy. (C) 2005 Pleiades Publishing, Inc.
