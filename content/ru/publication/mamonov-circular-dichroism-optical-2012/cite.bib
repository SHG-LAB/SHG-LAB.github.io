 abstract = {Influence of chirality on the optical second harmonic generated from planar array of G-shaped metamaterials is studied. Circular dichroism of these nanostructures manifests itself via different efficiency of left and right circularly polarized second harmonic that is observed for the samples of different handedness. This difference allows to distinguish between the two enantiomers.},
