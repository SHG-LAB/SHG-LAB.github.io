abstract: Giant third optical harmonic (TH) generation has been experimentally observed
  in island silver films. The TH intensity in the island silver films studied is more
  than two orders of magnitude higher than the value observed for the smooth surface
  of a homogeneous silver film. The mechanism of enhancement of the nonlinear cubic
  response is associated with the resonance enhancement of the local optical field
  at the TH wavelength, which is caused by the excitation of local surface plasmons
  in the ensemble of metal nanoparticles. (C) 2004 MAIK dqNauka / Interperiodicadq.
